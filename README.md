## Every project is a bet. Nearly all the people involved in a project may go to great lengths to conceal it, but that’s what it is. Understanding that every project is a bet can make managing it much easier.

>> “I long ago came to the conclusion that all life is 6 to 5 against.” – Damon Runyan.

I don’t bet on horse races (or anything else, in the conventional sense). So, I’m not perfectly certain what Damon Runyan is trying to say in this quote. Some research on the internet makes me think he’s saying that nothing in life has a probability of greater than 0.45. That’s slightly worse odds than the toss of a coin. 

This chapter is closely connected to another later chapter, [Chapter COMMITMENT]. Rather appropriately because we’re talking about odds, they’re two sides of the same coin. 

The commitment chapter talks about the fundamental human principle that is a powerful driver of our behaviour as humans which is called “Commitment and consistency.” This is the idea that we like to keep our promises and be consistent with our values, for the simple reason that not keeping our promises and not being consistent with our values makes us look mad or bad.

If we’re trying to behave in a way that avoids us looking mad or bad, then we might be tempted to only make promises that we can keep. If we only make promises about things we understand sufficiently well that there is no chance that we won’t be able to deliver on our promises. This would seem like a recipe for a wonderfully quiet life.

But there’s a catch. Most of those kinds of tasks, the ones that are so simple and predictable that when we do them, we can easily keep our promises, aren’t well paid. They’re simple tasks. They’re done either by low-skilled people nearby who we can’t possibly compete with on price, or they’re outsourced to people in other countries. 

From the point of view of the people who want these tasks done, there’s another complication. Simple tasks have simple, small rewards.  The big rewards, whether it be in terms of money, status, kudos or reputation, come from delivering risky projects. But a fundamental part of what makes a project risky is that it’s difficult to assess all of its potential benefits and liabilities.

The economist and philosopher Herb Simon coined the phrase “bounded rationality.” What he meant was that with any sufficiently complex endeavour, there’s a point where it’s no longer worth trying to consider all of the possible ins and outs. Examining all of the possible consequences would go on forever. At some point it becomes rational to draw a boundary around the thinking and either say “forget it,” or “fuck it.”

This means that on every project that has finally gotten the go ahead and has been funded, someone has done that. Someone has drawn a ring around all of the rational thought, stopped counting the potential costs, stopped identifying the risks and said, “fuck it.”
What this means is that someone has behaved recklessly. But very often it’s difficult to spot this, even at the moment that it’s happened, because almost immediately that this reckless act has occurred, a bunch of simultaneous operations leap in to action to cover it up.

### The hiding hand
The economist Albert Hirschmann coined the term “hiding hand” as a reference to another economist, Adam Smith’s term the “guiding hand.” Hirschmann worked on a number of projects for the world bank, many of which were obviously risky and unlikely to succeed, or pay off in the way that they suggested they would. He noticed that many of the people involved in the projects, even though they could see what he could see, contrived to avoid noticing that the projects were doomed, or would not deliver the value that they promised.

This is closely connected to the idea of “Agreed Activity” that we talked about when we talked about the Pirate ship. At the beginning of a project many of the people involved are strongly incentivised to avoid seeing the potential problems.  The people who are going to work on the project don’t want to point out any glaring problems because they would like the work. The people who have funded the project don’t want to hear that they’ve just sunk their money into something that’s going to be a disaster, and the people who got the project funded definitely don’t want anybody to hear that the idea that they’ve got everybody to support and work on is flawed in some way.

### Heads I win tails you lose
Why would anybody ever make risky bets? There are actually lots of reasons.

One reason is that some bets pay off, it may be very difficult to figure out the risks of the project failing but there is an obvious benefit that is in plain sight. For example. What if a competitor is showing that they have a clear advantage because they have a particular piece of technology? What if the competitor isn’t managing to use this technology ? But it looks like your organisation might be in a position to use it? Is now the time to carefully examine all the possible risks of trying to do the same thing? Or is now the time to draw the bounds of rationality relatively tightly. Is now the time to shrug and say “Fuck it?”

But there’s another aspect to the betting and risk taking surrounding projects. When a gambler makes a bet, if they win, they get the reward. But the down side of this of course is that if a gambler makes a bet and doesn’t win, they have to deal with the losses.

This isn’t mostly the case with projects, especially in big organisations.

Here’s the simple fact. People can start projects, those projects might be a gamble, those projects will very probably be a gamble. But if the project goes wrong, the people who started the project don’t have to be around to suffer the losses.

The is something that the writer Venkatesh Rao calls “Heads I win, tails you lose.” 

Some people have a way of looking at projects, which means that if a project is a success, they will be around to take the credit, and if a project isn’t a success they will be nowhere to be seen.

Of course, this changes the “Risk profile” of the kinds of projects that are likely get funded and developed. What kind of projects will someone try to get funded? If this someone knows that they can take the credit if the project goes well, but be nowhere to be seen if the project doesn’t go well? These could be very risky projects indeed.  

And understanding that the project that you're working on has profound consequences. It certainly has profound consequences for the idea of projects management being about keeping promises.
