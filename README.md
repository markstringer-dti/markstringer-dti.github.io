Introduction
------------

### Looking at problems in the right way can make them much easier to solve.

### This book offers 5 helpful ways of looking at project management that makes the problem much easier.

### Then it points out 5 unhelpful ways of looking at projects that should be avoided.

### Finally, it talks about some useful practical steps that you can take to give your projects the best chance possible of success.

### Why now?

#### We've always needed this since we started writing software, but now software is eating everything, it's a part of all our lives

#### Software is eating everything 

##### The individuals and companies that can produce the software the want and need are ruling the world

###### Bill Gates

###### Mark Zuckerberg

###### Jeff Bezos

### Why me?

#### Boring answer

##### I've been involved in digital since it was "IT" -- 30 years

##### I've been managing projects for 25 years

##### I've been delivering software development projects using Agile since 2010

#### Non-Boring answer

##### Unlike some others, I'm not under the illusion that project management is easy if only you find the right project management methodology and follow it closely

##### My experience of projects is that they are full of irrationality, negative emotions and can be extremely stressful

##### I'm questing to make projects, less stressful, more rational and less-filled with negative emotions -- and I think I have at least part of the answer

### Why you?

#### Do you work on software development projects?

##### Then it's a no-brainer, this book will be a ton of help

#### Are you somehow reliant on software development? 

##### Is the company that you work for hoping that a new software system will change it's fortunes?

##### Is your business being eaten by software?

#### Are you human?

##### You've probably been involved in some kind of project. 

##### You've probably been involved in trying to make something exist that doesn't already exist

##### If you have, then this books is also for you

Chapter 1 -- Streams
--------------------

### Existing products have a mature complete value stream

### Non-existing products have two value streams

#### The idea value stream

##### How it has attracted value is opaque.

##### Often wrapped in language that encourages enthusiasm and discourages close analysis.

##### Often the pet project of someone with influence, or has senior support

#### The real value stream

##### Doesn't exist -- needs to be built

##### Doesn't just not exist yet, its design needs to be discovered

###### What are the values that go into the value stream?

###### What are the parameters of time and cost?

### The contradiction

#### Starting to build the real value stream undermines / attacks the "dream" value stream

##### As we start to build things with technology, technological problems become obvious

##### As the project start to cost money and take time, the overall cost and time start to become obvious

##### If we talk to users, a mismatch between what they value and the values the product might offer become obvious

#### There are three solutions to this contradiction

##### Side with the dream

###### Ignore indications that there are problems with the dream

###### Stay "positive"

###### Avoid conflict

###### This ends disastrously, eventually

##### Side with reality 

###### Point out dream-killing realities as they emerge.

###### Be (at least seen) as pessimistic and negative

###### Take on the conflict directly

###### This ends disastrously, almost immediately

##### Negotiate

###### Acknowledge the dream

###### Acknowledge, and continue to reveal the reality

###### Negotiate a way through that incorporates the dream but is deliverable within the confines of reality.

#### The other four chapters in this "Positive way of seeing" section are essentially negotiation tactics.

Chapter 2 - The swamp
---------------------

### The space where we're trying to build a new value stream is complex, like a swamp.

#### Existing structures

#### Natural resources

#### Scarcity of resources

#### Residents

#### Potential residents

#### Owners

#### Property developers

#### Governors and regulators

#### Environmental campaigners

#### Law, religion, superstition

### You're trying to build something in this complex space

#### Some of these aspects of the swamp could kill your project stone dead

#### Some of these aspects of the swamp could make your projects a huge success

### It's a really good idea to learn about the swamp

#### User research

##### Talk to current residents (people using existing products)

##### Talk to potential residents (people who might want to use the product)

##### Talk to senior stakeholders who aren't "users"

##### Create a stakeholder map

#### "Probe" the swamp with working software

##### Nothing brings regulators into view, or exposes conflicts of interest within the organisation like getting something working

#### Talk regularly with senior stakeholders about risks and issues

##### Yes it's useful to talk through risks and issues with senior stakeholders

##### It's even more useful to talk through what's changed

Chapter 3 - Escape 
------------------

#### The ultimate goal of the project is to connect with its users

#### In many projects there are substantial barriers to this

##### Live data is hugely sensitive

##### Existence of the project is a secret

##### Before the system goes live it needs to be approved by various regulatory authorities

##### Budget for live servers is only pencilled in for launch 

##### "Legal requirements" and "reputational damage"

#### Releasing software to live undermines the value of the idea

##### The idea generates value

###### The promise that this new system will solve a large number of problems, or generate a large amount of revenue

##### The first steps towards reality will always look terrible compared with the idea

#### But you need to do it anyway

##### Getting software nearer to live always provides valuable information -- even when you don't make it to live

###### Pushing software nearer to live brings regulators you've never heard of out of the woodwork

###### Putting software on the platform for live reveals all kinds of issues that it's better to find out sooner rather than later

###### The nearer to 'real' data you get the more you'll learn

###### The way users respond to working software is always completely different to the way that they respond to specification lists or designs -- it will always surprise you

##### But there's another reason -- pull

###### Pull is connecting the users of a product

###### Pull completely changes the dynamic of a project

###### It's no longer completely dependent on the "fuel" of the shine from the idea

##### How push to escape

###### Push software as near live as you can get it

###### Chop the system in to bits

###### If you can't use real users, use "friendly" strangers.

###### If you can't use real data use the nearest thing you can find

##### "You're on your own on this one."

###### Almost no one else wants early working software

<div class="h7">Users want a fully formed system</div>

<div class="h7">Sponsors don't want to be embarrassed</div>

<div class="h7">Developers don't want to be embarrassed</div>

Chapter 4 -- The pirate ship
----------------------------

### In improvisation there is an idea called "agreed activity"

#### Agreed activity makes improvisation boring

#### Agreed activity makes projects less likely to succeed

### We need to deal with whatever is on the horizon

#### Dealing with the obvious ship on the horizon moves the story forward in improvisation

#### Dealing with the obvious ship on the horizon moves the project forward in project management

### But there's a complication

#### Few people want to hear bad news

#### Trying to point out the pirate ship can get you silenced, or fired

#### Revealing problems undermines supporters of the idea and attacks the reputation of the person who came up with the idea

### Conclusion / sophistication

#### What you see is all there is

##### So you need to change people's way of thinking by changing what they see

#### As we said when we talked about streams it's all about negotiation

##### Chris Voss -- "What do you want me to do?"

#### Connect to the "bad" but intuitive ways of seeing projects

##### Fast -- this is the thing that's limiting our speed

##### Commitment and consistency -- we might not be able to meet our deadline / promises because of \*this\* thing.

##### Simple -- this thing that we thought was simple, is turning out to be complicated because

##### All inclusive -- the goal of this project is X but that doesn't really tell us what to do about Y 

Chapter 5 -- Everything is a bet
--------------------------------

### All projects are risky

### The reason that any organisation is prepared to take the risks is that they think the reward will be bigger

### But a lot of organisations don't want to look like they are gambling

### Hence a lot of "project management theatre"

#### Loudly and explicitly adopting a methodology

#### Gate reviews

#### Spending lots of money on coaching

### Bounded rationality, Fuck it and Heads I Win, Tails You Lose

#### Bounded rationality

##### Might be tempted to think that looking really hard at all the possible upcoming complications is one way of de-risking a project

###### It's a good idea to do \*some\* investigation before starting a project

<div class="h7">This should be fixed length, fix resources because...</div>

###### There's a real danger of never being able to escape this phase and getting stuck in "analysis paralysis."

###### We have to "bound our rationality" at some point we have to say...

#### "Fuck it."

##### And some point, someone has to say "Fuck it." They have to shrug their shoulders, take the risk and green light the project

##### The people who are most likely to say "Fuck it" and take the risk, aren't people who have the best and most detailed understanding of the risks on a project.

##### They're the people who think that they can benefit from a project whether it succeeds or fails

##### This is because of a principle called...

#### Heads I Win Tails You Lose

##### If a project is success, they will be all over it and taking the credit

##### If a project is a failure, they will nowhere to be seen

##### Similarly during the life of a project, if the project is going well, they will be visible, as soon as there are problems, they'll disappear.

##### Bounded rationality, fuck it, and Heads I win, tails you lose, means that...

#### Some people will necessarily be in the game of overstating the benefits and understating the risks and costs so that "Fuck it" can get said a lot more

##### Because of HIWTYL they're happy for there to be as many projects going on as possible

#### Why on earth is this chapter in the "positive" ways of seeing part of this book

##### If all projects are inherently risky, and you're managing them, it's better if you know that

##### If projects are likely to have had their benefits over stated and their risks and costs overstated so that they can be green lit, it's better that you know that

##### If the people who got this project funded are likely to be elsewhere when the trouble starts, it's better to know that

#### Knowing these things, what practical actions can we take?

##### Try to get genuine risks and costs acknowledged

##### Improve the chance of the bet paying off

###### User research

<div class="h7">Doing user research can discover value</div>

###### Incremental delivery of working software

<div class="h7">Incremental delivering is a series of "small bets"</div>

<div class="h7">Feedback from these "small bets" informs future increments</div>

Part 2 -- Unhelpful ways of looking at projects
-----------------------------------------------

Chapter 6 -- Keeping a promise
------------------------------

### Why are we tempted to see projects are promises

#### Tradition project management -- waterfall

#### Fire and forget

##### Once the contract is signed senior management don't have to think about it

#### People who've made a promise are

##### More manipulable

##### Manageable

##### This is because

### Commitment and consistency is a powerful driver of human beings

#### We want to keep our promises and be consistent

##### People who don't keep their promises and aren't consistent in what they say are either mad or bad.

### But everybody knows this!

#### So now the game is to get people to commit to things

##### That they don't want to do

##### That they can't do

##### Example from Robert Cialdini's book -- asking people to work for a charity

### Typical project management agreement

##### Set of high-level project requirements

##### For a particular time

##### For a particular cost

### Looks like a commitment but

#### All projects are bets

#### Everybody secretly knows this

#### So the people who are agreeing to deliver

##### Are being coerced into something they know they can't deliver (or don't because they're poorly informed)

##### By someone who knows they can't deliver it (or don't because they're poorly informed).

#### It can't be a proper commitment if it was foolish or dishonest from the start

##### Can it?

#### Commitment and consistent Jujitsu

##### You agreed to this, and this entails this so technically you also agreed to this

##### This is just a negotiation ploy

### Seeing things in terms of commitment interferes with healthy working of the project

#### Difficult for anyone to admit ignorance

#### Even more difficult to admit dishonesty

#### Everyone starts from a position of distrust

##### Makes it much harder to call out the pirate ships

##### Makes the team reluctant to talk to users

###### Departures from what was initially agreed will be difficult to negotiate

###### Strong, strong temptation for "agreed activity"

<div class="h7">Reporting progress as expenditure</div>

#### Build trust

##### Do the things that you say you're going to do

##### Make small commitments

###### And deliver on them

##### Start to develop a channel for discussing difficulties as they arise

#### Remain comfortable in a state of tension

#### Discover value

#### Connect to pull

#### Negotiatiate

Chapter 7 -- Just a simple matter of 
------------------------------------

### Why are people tempted to see complex, risky projects as being simple?

#### Because a lot of talk and thinking about work imagines that it's simple

##### We hear a lot about the importance of hard work

##### We don't hear so much about the importance of subtle and complex thinking

#### Because they want to "avoid the pirate ship."

##### They don't want to do any of the thinking

### What's the problem with treating work as simple

#### Underestimates how varied the work can be

#### Underestimates how unexpected the work can be

#### Doesn't expect there to be parameters that need setting and trade-offs that need to be agreed

#### Can completely kill a project

##### Example

### What can you do about it?

#### It's pirate ship / Jerry Springer stuff

##### Call out the problems when they arise

##### Publicise the trade-offs and contradictions

##### Make it clear when you perceive there is disagreement

##### "Televise" the complexity

Chapter 8 -- Faster
-------------------

### Why are people tempted to want to go faster?

#### Most senior managers want to go faster

##### Development teams cost money

###### Faster is cheaper

###### Isn't it?

##### Initial estimates of duration were probably optimistic

###### Want to avoid the embarrassment/repercussions of an overrun

##### They imagine the shiny finished project will solve all their problems

##### Doesn't take into account tech debt

### Why simply going faster isn't necessarily a great idea

#### Beyond a certain pace, going faster isn't possible

##### You'll break people

##### They'll break things

##### They'll cheat

#### Beyond a certain pace, going fast isn't desirable

##### Corners get cut

##### Questions don't get asked

##### You can create an unmaintainable mess very quickly

##### People will leave / sign off sick / sue

### What can you do about it?

#### Show \*actual\* progress

#### Discourage

##### Corner cutting

##### Heroics

##### Burning man

#### Develop an understanding in the team of what theyr're capable of

Chapter 9 -- All
----------------

### People are tempted to want everything

##### Everything that was originally mentioned

##### Everything that emerged during the project

##### All the work required to meet non functional requirements

##### Everything the old system did

### Why are people tempted to want everything

#### They don't have to think

##### Another form of agreed activity

##### Avoids prioritisation

#### It's a strong negotiating position that connects with commitment and consistency

#### Feels like a risk reduction strategy

##### But is it

### What's wrong with wanting everything

#### Pushes focus away from what's important and valuable

#### "Not until we've finished"

#### Reduces likelihood of delivering early and actually connecting to value

#### Can lead to a "death march project" 

### What can you do about it?

#### Welcome deadlines

##### Use them as an opportunity to deliver something somewhere

##### Avoid putting them off because everything isn't finished

#### Wherever you can connect with users to understand priorities

##### Often, there is a small part of the whole project which is extremely valuable

#### Deliver working software

##### Connect to pull

###### Very often pull will completely re-organise the project's priorities

Part 3 -- Practical Suggestions
-------------------------------

Chapter 10 -- Chapter CAR
-------------------------

### What I'm advocating in this book is an empirical process

### There are three pillars to an empirical process

#### Transparency

#### Inspection

#### Adaptation

### Think of it like driving a car

#### You need to be able to see out of the wind screen

##### That's transparency

##### Other feedback

###### Instruments

###### warning lights

###### Sound of the engine

#### You need to look through the wind screen

##### That's inspection

##### And you need to look in the right place

###### Looking only inside the car isn't good

<div class="h7">But check the instruments</div>

<div class="h7">Check a map (if it's safe)</div>

###### Looking only at the horizon isn't good

<div class="h7">But check</div>

<div class="h8">Weather</div>

<div class="h8">Obvious signs of an obstruction</div>

<div class="h8">Signposts</div>

###### Mainly look at the road immediately ahead

### "Agile" practices are about improving and maintaining transparency, inspection and adaptation

#### Stand-up increases all three

##### Transparency -- team members saying what's going on

##### Inspection -- other team members hearing what they say

##### Adaptation -- changing what we do in light of what we hear

#### Planning 

#### Retrospective

#### Show and tell

#### Risks and Issues

Chapter 11 -- Fried Egg Agile
-----------------------------

Chapter 12 -- Tips from Negotiation
-----------------------------------

### Create artefacts

#### Burn up charts

#### Risk registers and charts

### Understand the basics

#### Lead time

#### Current constraint

### Side by side rather than face to face

#### What should we do about these things

### Explore the value landscape

#### Example

##### Kidnappers are asking for \$10,000 in Haiti

##### But a good night out in Haiti is \$100 

##### And it's Thursday

#### What's the equivalent for this project and this organisation?

Chapter 13 -- Advice for senior stakeholders
--------------------------------------------

### The streams

#### Understand the difference between:

##### Creating a new product

##### Manufacturing an existing one

### Escape

#### Understand the power of working software

##### De-risk a project

###### Connect with users early

###### Troubleshoot technical issues

###### Troubleshoot regulatory issues

### The swamp

#### Use judgement to disclose inner workings of the organisation

##### Avoid default 

### The Pirate Ship

#### Look for trouble

##### If there's no trouble it means 

###### Nothing is happening

###### Nobody is telling you what is happening

##### Any "messenger shooting" behaviour will be instantly received and understood

#### Play unhappy families

##### You're probably going to need something like SAFE of Less for inspiration

###### But you need to understand that 

<div class="h7">"All unhappy families are different"</div>

<div class="h7">And there are no happy organisations</div>

### The Bet

#### Understand

##### The project was a bet

###### You can use HIWTYL 

<div class="h7">Everybody else will!</div>

###### You can "lay off" the massive bet by allowing a series of smaller ones

### Commitment

#### The more you depend on this, the more damage you'll cause

### Fast

#### Understand there's such a thing as "too fast"

#### If you insist on a speed that's impossible you'll get

##### Damage

##### Deception

##### Disaster

#### Pay attention to constraints

##### If you can remove these, you probably can go faster

### All

#### Understand the value of some

##### Connect with real users

##### Connect with pull

##### De-risk the bet

#### Be open to the small thing that will deliver value

#### Forget things that keep getting deprioritised 

### Rule the world

#### Companies that can do this rule the world

#### Companies that can't do this work for the ones that can
