## Description
Would you like to rule the world? Then you need to know about swamps, pirate ships, and Sigmund Freud. You need to know why, eventually, someone has to say 'F**k it!' Software is everywhere in life. The people who get software written rule the world. If you want to go to space in your own rocket, it's pretty much the only way (see? Freud). Mark Stringer has been delivering software for 20 years. He's also a stand-up comedian. He's going to tell you how to rule the world by delivering the impossible, and tell you some jokes.
