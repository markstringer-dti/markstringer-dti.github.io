Delivering the impossible

[N] ways of looking at software development project management

## Chapter INTRODUCTION -- Introduction
=========================================

Many projects appear impossible. Most of them aren't. If you look at them in the right way and are doing the right things to manage them, most projects can deliver value to their owners and their users. Looking at projects in the right way and managing them in the right way will allow you to see the projects that genuinely are impossible and get out of them as soon as you can.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The title of this book is "Delivering the impossible." But of course,
you, or anyone, can only deliver possible things. So why did you pick up
this book that has a contradiction right on the front cover, in its
title?

Here are some reasons why you might have done.

How about this? You are working on a project. You're a member of the
project team or you're the manager, and you feel stuck. It seems like
the project you've been asked to deliver is impossible.

You're not quite sure when this happened. But at some point, someone
told someone that the project would be finished by a certain date
(probably Christmas). Instinctively, you know that your team can't
deliver it.

Maybe it's worse than that, maybe you still don't even know what needs
to be delivered. People are telling you that the project needs to be
finished by a certain date. But when you, or your team try to get a
definitive answer of what finished would mean, you don't get the
answers you need.

Even if you do know what should be delivered, you're certain that your
team can't deliver it on time.

In every direction, there seem to be problems that you can't solve. You
have somehow found this book. You thought it might be worth a read.

Yes, maybe it's that. You're the project manager. Well good, because
this books is specifically targeted towards you. Obviously this book may
be of interest to other people but if you're a project manager, managing
a software development project, this books is especially for you.

You have picked up this book. That probably means that you're starting
to get this uncomfortable feeling that the project isn't going well.
And for the sake of the company, well, that and the sake of your career,
you need this project to go well. You realise, you don't know what you
can do to help the project succeed. You wonder if there any useful tips
in this book, for you, or for your team. Is there anything that *you*
could do to help the project do better?

Maybe you're working on a project, but you aren't any kind of boss.
Maybe you're one of the people who does the work. Yes, yes, you know
you're going to get paid no matter whether the project is a success or
not. But still, you'd rather work on projects that are a success.

So, let's get right to it. How do you deliver a project that is
impossible? The quick answer is that you look at it from a different
point of view, you find a way of seeing it, that makes it so that it
isn't impossible.

Of course, that's another reason why you might have picked up this
book. Even though you think your project is impossible, you haven't
given up.

Well, part of the reason for not giving up is that you know that a lot
of things that seem impossible do actually get fixed, given the right
skills and expertise. You know this from other parts of your life. That
it's not a good idea to give up immediately when things get difficult.
Often things do get better if you persist. If you look at them from a
different angle, if you see them through a different lens, suddenly
things that seemed impossibly start to click into place.

The software pioneer Alan Kay said, "Point of view is worth 80 IQ
points." What I take this to mean is that if you can only figure out
the right way to look at something, you can do much cleverer things.
What I'm trying to show in this book are different ways of looking at
the problem of project management. The idea is that if we can only find
the right point of view, we can be much cleverer about what we do.

So, you might expect a book called "Delivering the Impossible" to have
a bunch of different ways of looking at problem projects. You might even
expect some useful ways of looking at the ones that seem totally
impossible.

What you would like and expect from a book titled "Delivering the
Impossible" is some kind of guide. You'd expect some kind of handbook
for dealing with projects that seem impossible.

You might expect to find methods for spotting issues that make a project
"impossible". You might then expect the book to go on to talk about
what to do in these situations. How to make a project reasonable and
deliverable and give it the best chance of success.

What if a project is genuinely impossible? A book called "delivering
the impossible" should tell you how to spot it. And it should give
advice on what to do in such circumstances. It should tell you how to
keep yourself and others sane and safe. How to get away from a lost
cause and move on to do well on other projects. How to ride into the
sunset to fight another day.

Well, this is that book. And it tries to meet all these expectations.
This is especially that book if what you do involves the development of
software.

If you read this book, you'll learn how to improve your management of
impossible-seeming situations. Things might look bad. But there are
often some quite simple things you can do to turn projects around and
help them do well.

### Why This?

What might be a shortened version of why you picked up this book?
Because you're involved in a project and you don't know what you're
doing. On the whole, in your life and your work, you would really like
to feel that you *do* know what you're doing.

My experience is that knowing what you're doing isn't that different
from having no idea what you're doing. You're doing very similar,
simple things, but being guided by the right way of looking at things.
And that's why this book is subtitled 6 metaphors for successful
project management. Metaphors are ideas, ways of looking at things.
Doing the right things is literally about having the right ideas, seeing
things in the right way

The reason for describing these different points of view is to make good
on Alan Kay's claim. The aim is to make you much smarter, to make you
feel like you "know what you're doing" when it comes to managing
projects.

And in this way, this isn't like most books that offer to improve your
success at project management. Most books like that suggest a particular
Agile method. For example, Scrum [Ref], or Extreme Programming
[Ref]. Other books talk about how to coach teams in the use of these
methods. Other books talk about a particular part of the Agile process.
It could be writing "user stories" or running retrospectives. And
there are books that focus on the technical aspects of the process. You
can read about test driven development and wonder how often it is
"honoured more in the breach that the observance [Ref]". You can
read about Dev Ops [Ref] and continuous integration [Ref].

I'm not knocking these books. Some are brilliant and I've referenced
some of the ones that I like best in the bibliography. But I don't
think they're enough.

Following an Agile method like Scrum is a good way of improving your
chances of project success. It's what I almost always do if I'm in
charge of delivering a software development project.

And Scrum works best when it's combined with XP engineering practices.
For software development, it's not really going to work at all unless
it's combined with some form of automated test coverage. And then on
top of that you probably also need continuous integration and continuous
delivery.

And if you haven't done this before as a team, you are going to need
some outside help. It is really hard just to learn it from books.
Bringing in an Agile coach, somebody who has done it before, will
seriously improve your chances of success.

But unfortunately, this isn't enough either. You need to do more than
this if your project has any realistic chance of doing well. You need to
develop the ability to see things from different points of view. And,
having developed that ability, you need to be able to act, and help and
inspire others to act on what you see.

OK, I think it's time for a real example of what I'm talking about. In
the next chapter, I talk about pirate ships and "agreed activity". I
talk about how you need to notice when you and your team are agreeing to
ignore the big issues. You need to spot when you are all repeatedly
doing something simple and safe, because in the end this can be very
dangerous.

I talk about how you need to stop your team mopping the decks. Rather
you need to help them to look at the horizon and face the approaching
pirate ship.

Why is it important that you tackle "pirate ship" [Chapter CHREF)]
issues as soon as you see them? Because if you don't, you and your team
will end up [CHREF] in trench warfare. And once you're there, it's
much harder, although still not impossible, to help your project do
well.

Why do you need to show progress and call out problems as soon as you
can in a project, even in the face of hostility from the people who are
paying you to do it? Why do you need to put working software in the
hands of people who might get some value from using it as soon as you
can?

I explain this using the Daoist idea of flowers and fruit. Flowers
appeal to us straight away. But they aren't sustaining. Fruit is
difficult to grow and even more difficult to make tasty. But it feeds
people.

Maybe you're thinking: "My software development project is in trouble.
It's already cost millions of pounds. I can't find any way out of this
that doesn't cost millions more. The last thing that I need is some
dreamy guff about pirate ships and trenches, fruit and flowers."

But this book tries to provide something solid, nutritious, and
sustaining. It sets out ways of seeing projects, those points of view
that Alan Kay talks about. The contention of this book is that this is
what you need when your project looks impossible - different points of
view. It offers the genuine possibility of knowing what you're doing.
And once you know what you're doing, once you have the right way of
seeing, the right idea, a lot of things that previously seemed
impossible can seem a lot less so.

### Why now?

OK, you might think. OK, I get it, seeing things in a different way is
useful. But this project has some specific problems. I just want to fix
them. I don't have time to kick everything up in the air and
philosophise. Maybe we could do this another time.

Part of what I want to show you in this book is that now is the time.
Well, now is way, way too late. But better late than never.

We've needed better ways of thinking about software projects since the
1940s. Humans have been writing software for at least 75 years and
we're still not very good at it. That is because it is very hard.

I remember listening to an explanation of a "Waterfall" approach to
project management. Waterfall is the traditional approach to project
management. It was regarded as the absolute best way of managing
projects until very recently. There was just one problem with it. It was
hardly ever a success.

My first job was in the mid-nineteen nineties. I remember thinking
"this will never work." And I soon saw that it didn't.

In my first two years as a software developer I worked on a software
project for a big oil company. We managed it using the waterfall
approach. This was the way nearly everybody managed software development
at the time. And it's called the waterfall approach, because work
happens in stages, like the steps of a waterfall.

Stage one: all the requirements for the project were carefully written
down. So, at the end of this stage we had a huge requirements document.
I didn't join the project until this had already happened, and it had
taken a year.

There were two problems with this stage. Firstly, how did we know we
were finished? We didn't have any way of testing when we had *all* of
the requirements. Secondly, in the time that it took us to write down
the requirements, the world changed. What changed? All sorts of things.
It was an oil company, then, as now, what goes onin the world of
politics, wars and natural disasters affected its priorities. And all of
these events are difficult, if not impossible to predict. Added to that,
inside big organisations big corporations, there are also political
manoeuvrings. There is a hierarchy and the people in that hierarchy are
continuously struggling for influence and position. So, the people in
that hierarchy change.

We were trying to write software that would work in this sea of
changing. But as we did that, guess what else was changing? The
software! Not the software that we'd written, the software that we were
trying to write it on. The project was developed at the point when
Windows 95 started to be available. And this caused a different set of
problems. Should we use the new technology? If we did, we had to deal
with all of the teething troubles that came with working with something
that was brand new. Should we use old, green screen, more reliable
technology? If we did, we had to deal with clients who were
uncomfortable about paying so much for software that looked so old
fashioned.

All this change was going on in the background, while we tried our best
to put together a high-level design so that we could move to stage two.

Stage two: we turned these high-level requirements into a detailed
design. In one of the projects this stage took a year and £6 million
pounds. And it only stopped, not when there was any feeling that the
design was ready, but when the budget for design ran out.

Stage three: after the first two stages, which took years, we started to
write the software. And that? That took another year

Stages four and five. Then came separate stages of internal and then
external "factory acceptance" testing by the customer. Then and only
then did the software go live.

Unfortunately, on this project, (and next one that I worked on) then
went through an extra stage between testing with users and launch. What
was that extra stage? It was litigation.

When the customers finally got to see the final product of what they'd
asked for it was four and a half years since they'd made their original
request. And so it substantial parts of it weren't what they wanted. Not
to mention that the software only ran on old-fashioned "Green Screen"
terminals, and not on the new, modern windows 95 GUI.

In the long years since they'd specified the project, it's the world
had changed. But had specification document captured exactly what the
users wanted, even all that time ago. It's almost impossible that it
did.

But now, nearly five years had passed. The customer had had those long
years to think more about what they wanted. What the users had asked for
had gone through several stages of work. The systems designers and
developers had done their bit. The the internal testers took the
software through its paces and then finally testers working for the
customer. By the time those initial specifications had got to the end of
that pipe, it's not surprising that this wasn't exactly what the
customer wanted.

But there was one intriguing thing about this whole sorry, expensive
process. Something that I only fully appreciated about that first
project that I worked on, much, much, later. When the customers finally
saw the software, decided it wasn't what they wanted and threatened to
sue, something interesting happened. The management of the project
called in a guy whose only job was to rescue projects that got
themselves into this state.

His name was Terry. Terry would sit down with the customers and find out
which bit of the software was most important to them. Which bit did they
*really* need most? He would then negotiate a bit of room for
manoeuvre for our company. A bit of time and a bit of money so that the
software that was most valuable to them could get built. And then, when
that was done, he would repeat the process. Bit by bit, the software
would start to resemble what the client really wanted. At some point it
would become valuable enough to them that the threat of a lawsuit
wouldn't get mentioned any more.

And what Terry was doing, well it sounds like iterative, Agile software
development.

Yes, this book is going to advocate an iterative, incremental approach
to software development. But obviously, it isn't the first book to do
that.

We could and should have been doing this right from the beginning. And
in the most extreme circumstances after a lot of time and expense, under
threat of legal action, we kind of were.

Seventy-five years ago, it would have been great for us to have really
got the hang of delivering software projects. Still, it's better late
than never. Being good at writing software has never been a more
important competitive advantage. For organisations, teams, and even
individuals, it really helps to be good at writing software. Being good
at developing software that customers want, that is genuinely valuable
to them, in a timely manner, has never been more valuable. Being good at
software development, has become a way of, literally, conquering the
world.

Am I overstating things a bit? I don't think I am. As Marc Andreessen
pointed out more than ten years ago, software is eating everything. And
since he wrote that article, software has increased its appetite. It's
taken huge bites out of sex and dating, politics, social life, music and
television. Some companies are good at developing software -- Amazon,
Facebook, Google, Alibaba. And some of those companies are now more
powerful than some governments.

But ironically, the craft of managing software delivery doesn't seem to
be so susceptible to being eaten by software. It remains a resolutely
human pursuit.

### Why me?

Let's say that you believe me. You agree that now is a good time to get
very good at software development. You realise that that also includes
managing software development. Why should you listen to me?

Well, I've been working in the software development industry since
1994. First as a developer, writing software for oil companies, the
military and then a new-fangled thing called the internet. Then I worked
as a researcher, first for Xerox, then for Cambridge University.

Working for Xerox gave me my first experience of project management. I
think they gave me the project management job because they'd seen how
well I could write code. I managed a couple of guys from former East
Germany who were writing code for the first "smart" phone -- the Nokia
9000. These guys were some of the only people prepared to put up with
how awful it was to write for this phone. They'd learned to program on
Commodore 64s smuggled over the wall into the DDR.

This was a really dumb phone. It had the same operating system as some
sewing machines and it was very difficult to write anything for it. But
working with these two guys, we managed to get a working prototype of
our document access application. And at one point during the madness of
the first internet bubble, rumours of our product were said to have put
tens of dollars on the Xerox share price. Then the bubble burst.

The Xerox lab closed and I found myself working for Cambridge
University. This gave me my first real experience of using iterative,
user-centred design. We designed a system to help school kids put
together discursive arguments. The European Union funding was for an
interface that was tangible. That means an interface that you could
touch, pick up. This project taught me a lot.

It taught me that ideas evolve. We started out with brightly coloured
boxes with topical ideas on them "People don't like graffiti." We
ended up with a fancy (for its time) hybrid physical and electronic
interface. It used rfid-tagged cards with statements like "People
don't like graffiti," to search the internet. When you put a plastic
card that had an rfid tag hidden in it on a special tile that could read
the tags, a website associated with the statement appeared on a screen.
This might have been the only piece of software that I've ever written
that got "oohs" and "ahs" when we demonstrated it.

Taking a user-centred design approach means believing that whatever
you're building needs to fit in a particular situation. The situation
that we were designing for was English state schools. At the time they
were closely regulated. Any activity that we were going to get the kids
to do with our fancy new interface would have to fit in a lesson plan.
But because this was a research project, we were also trying to please
our other research partners and in the end, our funders. I didn't think
of it then like this, but that project was definitely a swamp, as we
discuss in Chapter [N].

Look this is all very well, but it's starting to sound a bit "I was
born at an early age."

You should listen to me because I know how to deliver software projects.
I've been doing it now for more than ten years. Mostly I've been
successful. The projects that weren't successful were either "trench
warfare" projects when I arrived (e'll talk about those kinds of
projects in chapter [N]) or they were projects that turned out to be
things that nobody wanted. We'll talk about how to avoid those in
chapters [N] and [N]. Or people wanted them, but nobody could make
them pay, again - chapters [N] and [N]. For example, it turns out
that users are quite keen on personal loan websites. It also turns out
that most of the people who want a personal loan are exactly the kind of
people to whom you probably shouldn't lend money. That was a project
that would have greatly benefitted from user research up front. People
need to keep re-learning that user research is a good idea.

Some of these projects that were successful and made millions of pounds
for their owners. Some of them weren't about money at all. They were
literally about making the world a better place. They helped their users
do scientific research. They helped solicitors defend their clients in
court run more smoothly.

And I really believe that some of those projects wouldn't have done
well, or might not have done so well, if I hadn't been involved.
That's about as much as you can ever say if you're a project manager.

And I learned from all of them. By working on so many projects, good and
bad, my thinking about what project management was and how to do it
well, changed.

One of the things that I learned is that all projects are different. You
might think that was obvious, but it's understanding this that probably
made the Japanese (for a while at least) the most successful car making
nation in the world. And it's forgetting this that allows some boss or
other in every project that I've ever worked on decide that it's a good
idea to try to compare the "productivity" of different teams. Now's not
the time to talk too much about this, but really. This isn't that
obvious and it is very important and we'll come back to it in [Chapter
N].

Another thing that I learned is that there's a lot more to learn.

And part of the reason why I've helped these projects is that I try to
think about them in the ways I'm going to talk about in this book.

### Why you?

What might happen if you try to deliver a project and you haven't read
this book? Or, you aren't aware of the ideas in this book? Well,
there's a good chance that you won't spot the pirate ship [Chapter
N] until it's too late. If that happens, there's a very good chance
that you'll end up in a trench warfare project [Chapter N]. It might
take you far too long to realise that there's nothing you can do about
it, and that you need to leave.

Let's say you and your team are really good, or really lucky or both.
Team members can admit to themselves that there's a pirate ship coming.
They alert others who need to know of the looming problem. They tackle
the problems that they need to tackle. Even so, if you, or they,
haven't read this book you won't know about value streams, flowers and
fruit [Chapter STREAMS]. And not knowing about that, there's a good
chance that they won't push in the right direction. They might be
tempted to delay putting working software in the hands of users.

If you haven't read about the swamp [Chapter SWAMP], there's a good
chance that you won't have hired the best user research team you can
find. You might even be telling yourself, or agreeing with others, that
you don't really need any user research.

So, you won't have a detailed map of the user and stakeholder
ecosystem. That means that even if you tackled the pirate ship the
minute you saw it, there might still be trouble. Even if you pushed
working software as far as you could along the right dimensions, your
project might still not go well. Without a map of the stakeholder
ecosystem to influence decisions, the chances are that your project
won't do as well as it could. There's less chance that you'll have
moved from "flowers" to "fruit" and you'll have no idea what that
means.

Finally, if you don't read this book, there's a good chance you're
going to feel bad, even when you're doing the right things. In fact, if
you don't read this book, there's a chance you're going to feel good,
even when you're doing the wrong things.

Why? because if you don't read this book, you probably won't know
about how wrong and damaging the metaphor of "Project management as
keeping a promise" (Chapter [N] really is and what you can do to
escape its evil clutches.

So, by now, we might as well admit to each other, you are reading this
book. And if you carry on, very soon, you're going to know about agreed
activity because we talk about it in [Chapter SHIP]. This means that
in the early stages of the project, as you and your team start to
encounter problems, you would try to "televise" those problems. You
would make them obvious to everyone who needs to know. Once we've talked
about agreed activity and what happens if you don't try to disrupt it,
we'll talk about the swamp [Chapter SWAMP]. When you start to
understand the implications of the swamp, you will be looking to involve
user researchers in your team, and you'll be looking to release working
software as soon as you possibly can. You and your team would have been
trying to "promote" working software, to get it as near as it could
possibly get to the hands of real users.

And all that you've learned so far, agreed activity, the pirate ship,
the swamp, the need for user research and working software all of this
is going to prepare you for understanding the different between flowers
and fruit.

In chapter [N] you would read about the pirate ship and the dangers of
avoiding it. That means when you do come across a big problem that the
team is ignoring, there's a good chance you would tackle it. By
tackling problems early, there's a much better chance that you'll
avoid the pain and misery of trench warfare.When you've read this book,
you'll know, because you've read all about commitment and consistency
in [Chapter COMMITMENT] about the dodgy metaphor of project management
as the keeping of promises, why it makes you feel so back, even if you
never promised the things that it's claimed you did.

When you've read this book do you know what? Not all, but more of the
projects that seemed impossible might turn out to be possible. You might
just get lucky. Yes, it still needs a lot of luck. You might manage to
put working software in the hands of users. And when you and your team
do that guided by user researcher and feedback from frequent releases
for work software ,you'll have found something that is not only
valuable to the users, but also creates value for the organisation. Your
project will be a success.

## Chapter SHIP - Ignoring the Pirate Ship - Agreed activity
==============================================================

The main danger to any project is the refusal of the people working on it to recognise the risks. If the risks are recognised and acknowledged, the team can do something about the ones that can be addressed and figure out how to work around the ones that can't.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the great things about living in London is that you can sign up
to all sorts of classes. Over the past ten years, I've signed up for
improvisation classes over and over again. Why? Because my experience is
that every time that I go to an improvisation class, I learn something
new. I have new experiences, and these often, in some way or other, turn
out to be useful in real life.

One of the key ideas in improvisation is that you should avoid what's
called "blocking". For example, an improvised scene starts with
someone knocking on a door. The scene might go something like this.

Imagine that there are a group of performers on stage for an improvised
scene. Often to start a scene, the actors will ask for a suggestion from
the audience. Someone in the audience suggests "The deck of a tall
sailing ship."

Here's what might happen.

Kevin: [Putting mimed fake telescope to their eye] Look over there! On
the horizon? There's a ship, and a flag! Is that a skull and cross
bones?

Now the other performers have a choice to make. One obvious choice here
is to "yes and" the Pirate ship.

Janice: Oh my God the Pirates are coming. Haul up the sails, let's try
to outrun them.

Leena: Oh my God the Pirates are coming. The cannons! Load the cannons!

Mei: Oh my God the Pirates are coming. Quick! Hide in the lifeboats!

All these are good selections. Of course, the audience hope that hiding
in the lifeboats won't work but will result in lots of comedy.

Sometimes in this kind of situation, someone makes a different kind of
suggestion. Something like this:

Nadia: Hey! Let's wash the decks!

Oliver, Pam, Quentin, Rana and Shug: Yes! Let's!

For some of the performers on the stage, this can seem like an
attractive thing to do. But of course, for the audience, it's a very
bad idea. Once somebody mentions the pirate ship, the audience wants to
see it arrive. The audience wants to see what a chase between this ship
and a pirate ship looks like. They want to see if this crew can load a
cannon, point it in the right direction and fire it. They want to see
the pirate king and see what he'll do to the crew members who are
hiding in the lifeboats.

They don't want to see everyone on the stage miming mopping the floor.

Improvisers who don't have a lot of experience are really tempted to
just scrub the decks. It is much more attractive than dealing with the
implications of the pirate ship.

Why? Because no one wants to be changed. That was the realisation of the
theatrical innovator Keith Johnstone who developed his own style of
improvised theatre in the 1950s. He also wrote several books: "Impro"
and "Impro for storytellers." In his books, Johnstone talks about
people who are new to improvisation. He describes them wanting to do
safe, repetitive activities. Washing the decks is an example of this. He
refers to this as "agreed activity."

He explains that putting people on a stage in front of an audience makes
them scared. Scared people try to make themselves safe, even if what
they're doing is making the group as a whole less safe. Even if what
they do bores the audience.

Part of the skill of being a good improviser is knowing how to avoid
this need to stay safe. Instead, good improvisers have the courage to
move the story forward. When they hear the suggestion, good improvisers
accept that there's a pirate ship. They make the story interesting and
move it forward by dealing with what that means.

What's fascinating is that all novice improvisers seem to know that
mopping the decks is the "right" thing to do. There isn't a long
discussion. It happens in less than a second. Even though, from the
point of view of the audience, it's exactly the wrong thing to do. What
this shows is how good we are at shying away from things that might be
dangerous. Especially, we tend to avoid anything that will make us
change our behaviour or our thinking.

Johnstone has one suggestion to help the improvisers avoid this "agreed
activity". This is to have a director who is watching the improvisers
and can speak out and direct them during the show. The director spots
which suggestions will move the story forward. She also sees which
suggestions are invitations to "agreed activity" and tells the actors
to avoid them.

Let's say a director is watching a scene where there'd been a
suggestion of washing the decks. She might allow the crew ten seconds of
deck washing without advancing the action. But then she might shout
"The deck's clean! The pirate ship is getting nearer! Deal with the
Pirate ship!"

So if everyone's first instinct is to mops the decks, rather than to do
the "right" thing and tackle the pirate ship, how can anyone who is
learning improv improve? It easy to shout "deal with the pirate ship" if
you're offstage. If you're on stage, improvisers call this the "red mist
descending", the lizard part of your brain takes over. You're scared,
you're going to do the thing that makes you safe and that's boring and
so ultimately, not safe.

So how do you make sure that then next time that you're in this
situation, you don't

Often improv classes take the form of a set of games, and improv
practice for mature improvisers, take the form of games. The purpose of
the games isn't only to have fun (although of course that's
important). Good improv games are also drills, that focus on improving
one particular aspect of the improviser's abilities.

There is one game that helps get improvisers out of the habit of agreed
activity. It's called "new choice."

It can be used as guard rails, or training wheels, to help improvisers
avoid blocking and agreed activity and move the action of a scene
forward. It gives them a chance to go for that instinctive agreed
activity option, but then to have that choice immediately wiped out and
replaced by a new, better one by an independent referee.

The way that the "new choice" game works is that two improvisers get
involved in a dialogue. A third improviser acts as a referee. The two
improvisers start a dialogue. If the referee isn't happy with one of
the responses that the improvisers give, she can shout "new choice"
and the improviser has to say something else.

With this simple exercise, an improviser can make sure that a scene
keeps moving forward and avoids blocking. Also, the improvisers involved
in the scene get to hear the suggestions that are rejected. They start
to get a sense of what "good" suggestions and responses look like.
They start to get better at making them first time.

Coming back to the ship example that we've been using, with three
improvisers: Kate, Leena and Mei - if Mei is the referee, a scene might
go like this:

Leena: Look! A pirate ship!

Kate: Oh no, we'd better be ship shape if the pirates visit. Let's
scrub the decks.

Mei: New choice!

Kate: Let's polish the brass handles!

Mei: New choice!

Kate: Let's hide in the lifeboats.

Mei: [Nods indicating that's fine]

Leena: Here we are. The lifeboat.

Mei: New choice!

Leena: Oh my God! Where are the lifeboats?

And so on.

Why am I telling you this? Because, of course, this idea of agreed
activity is useful, not just in improvised theatre, but also in project
management. On a software development project, when a team comes across
something that's the equivalent of a pirate ship, there's a strong
tendency to avoid it. And it's the job of the project manager to either
play the game of "new choice" with the team and get them to select a
better option that moves the action of the project forward, or in other
cases, like the director role that Johnson played in some of his improv
productions to just shout "deal with the pilot ship."

People who work on a software development project will often choose
agreed activity rather than moving the action forward. They will fill
their days with simple problems that they know how to fix rather than
tackling big, complex problems. Like improvisers, they do this as a way
of avoiding having to think or needing to change. Often this
"decision" to avoid tackling the problems is taken without much
discussion, or even conscious thinking. It is instinctive. Just as it is
with improvisers on stage.

You might think what I'm saying here is that it's the nature of
software development teams to be lazy and cowardly. I am not saying
that. Not at all.

The important thing to understand about agreed activity is that we all
fall prey to it. In new, uncomfortable and unpredictable situations we
will all be tempted to revert to the easy, the unthinking and the
familiar. But, as in improv, there are things that we can do to help get
us out of the deck mopping rut and move us on to tackling the pirate
ship.

You might think that this is an interesting idea. But you might not yet
be seeing how this idea of agreed activity and the story of the pirate
ship can be directly applied to the more prosaic and practical world of
project management.

Agile project management provides lots of opportunities for you as the
project manager and the team to spot the pirate ship. Every day there's
a "stand-up" meeting. The team talks about what they did the day
before and what they're going to do today. And in stand-up, team
members also talk about any problems they have that are blocking their
progress. Reporting these "blockers" is the most important bit of the
stand up. Because these blockers are the project's pirate ships.

Similarly, retrospectives at the end of every sprint provide bigger
chunk of time for the team to reflect on how things are going and call
out anything that might clouding the horizon.

But just because there's an opportunity, that does mean that it's one
that anyone takes advantage of. Of course, if there's one big thing
that's blocking progress, that might be the thing that no-one talks
about. Remember, agreed activity is instinctive. It happens often nearly
silently and instantly. The signs that there is a pirate ship that needs
tackling might not be obvious at first. There might not be an obvious
Jolly Roger flying and the sound of "Arrrrrgh!"

So sometimes, the way to look for the pirate ship might be to look for
agreed activity. If some members of the team have the same update with
no variation for days and days. That's a sign of agreed activity.
Another sign is when the team plans a task and then it doesn't get done
for days, weeks, possibly months.

Nobody on the team decides to pick it up. It may well be that no
discussion has been had within the team about why they don't want to
pick up this task and tackle it. As with the crew on the improvisational
stage, they made an agreement. They might not have talked about it. But
they all agreed not to tackle that task. Of course, in these situations,
it's the job of the project manager to point to that task and ask what
it is about it that means everyone is avoiding it.

When they do that, the project manager is acting as the director. They
are sitting "off stage" and encouraging the team to tackle something
that they've all quietly agreed to ignore. Sometimes, the project
manager must take on this "director" role. But of course, it's much
better, and much more powerful for the team to do this for themselves.

So, one place to spot the pirate ship is stand-up. Another is the
retrospective. That's a meeting that happens, typically every two weeks
where the team talks about how the previous sprint went. In the
retrospective, the team asks these questions:

* What went well?

* What didn't go so well?

* What could be done better?

Here's one of the many strange things about project management. Very
often everybody who is working on a project knows what's wrong with the
project. They know what the pirate ship is. So why aren't they saying
what they know? Maybe it's because they've tried to say or have said
and have been ignored. Maybe it's because they've been told to back
off. Maybe they've been threatened with disciplinary action, or even
disciplined for pointing out the problem. Or maybe, as we've said, none
of the above have happened on this particular project. It's just the
same silent and nearly instantaneous collaboration that happens when an
improv troupe agrees to scrub the decks.

Just imagine that in an improv show, one of the performers shouted
"Look! A pirate ship!" and a director sitting next to the stage
responded by saying "Shut up about the pirate ship! I don't want to
hear any more of this negative thinking. Clean the decks! Any more talk
of a pirate ship and you're off the show."

A leader doesn't need to tell the team to shut up about the pirate
ships and clean the decks very many times. Once will be enough to do the
damage. If the leadership response to reports of problems isn't
positive and helpful, the leaders will already - from just one example -
be on their way to creating one of the strangest problems that I've
seen. And I've seen it repeatedly: a highly skilled, highly paid team
who've given up trying to tell the bosses what's wrong.

The team identified some problems. They explained to the leadership what
those problems were. The leadership ignored them, or got angry, or
suggested that if the team knew how to do their jobs, there wouldn't be
a problem. The team noticed this. They understood. They'd found an
agreed activity - doing as they're told. They're smart people, so
they've learned really quickly when it's better to not try to speak
out or think for themselves.

I saw this phenomenon so many times when I was working as an Agile coach
that I gave it a very depressing name - "the beaten down team." Often,
I would have been asked by the leaders to give this team an Agile
training course. The idea being that a course, all by itself, would
magically improve the performance of the team, or the performance of the
project.

No matter how many times they have been beaten down, a team will still
respond to the right kind of opportunity to feedback. If you run
retrospectives and give people an opportunity to speak, they will speak.
They will talk if they think you are listening. They will see and
appreciate you doing your best to raise their problems with the people
who need to know about them. And sooner or later, they will talk about
the pirate ship. Whatever it is that is the main problem that is
preventing the project from succeeding. The thing that no one is talking
about. And when you do find out what it is, it might be hard to take
your jaw off the floor.

Here's a story. I worked as a coach on a project that was really
struggling. We had a retrospective.

One big problem emerged. All of the requirements for the project were
written by a single business analyst. The team's main difficulty was
that they couldn't understand what the business analyst had written.

What struck me straight away was that the business analyst wasn't in
any of the Agile meetings, not in the stand ups, not in planning and not
in the retrospectives. In an Agile project, the business analyst is part
of the team - not outside of the team sending in requirements.
Especially ones that cannot be understood.

So, my response to this problem was to suggest that the business analyst
should be invited to stand-up meetings, and the planning meetings. And
retrospectives and show and tells. This was where I noticed the
developers looked at each other sideways - this is always a sign that
you are finally getting to the real issue.

"We're not allowed to talk to the business analyst."

"What? That's mad! I'm sure that can't be right."

Yes, it was mad. Yes, it was right. Well, it was what was happening. Of
course, it was very wrong.

I tried to talk to the business analyst. I emailed him asking for a
meeting. I got a phone call from his boss saying I wasn't allowed to
talk to him.

And of course, there was no way that the project was going to get
anywhere in its current state. The team needed, at the very least, to
talk to the person who could tell them what the product was supposed to
do.

My suggestion was that we get the business analyst to sit with the team
and to attend stand ups and retrospectives. When this finally happened,
progress on the project started to improve.

Right here, in this first chapter, we're getting down to the nitty
gritty of what project management really is. One thing that project
management really is, is a willingness to look on the horizon and look
out for problems. Another thing that it is, is willingness to spot when
teams have slipped into a pattern of agreed activity and help them to
get out of it.

But we aren't sailors, and we aren't fighting pirates. The only tools we
have at our disposal are conversations. Meetings. And yes, one crucial
meeting is the stand up because it's there that team members highlight
what's stopping them getting things done. And another important meeting
for tackling the pirate ship is the retrospective where broader, more
structural problems with the project often come to light. But there are
a couple more meetings that are also a vital part of identifying the
pirate ship and tackling it. One is a standard Agile meeting - the
"Show and Tell." This is a meeting where the development team show the
outputs of what they have been working on in the last "Sprint" -
typically two weeks. Who do they show it to? At the very least, they
show it to the product owner who acts as a representative of all the
people who want the project to happen. But they can also invite other
people who are interested. Pretty much anyone who is allowed to see it
should be able to come along.

Going back to the story of the incomprehensible requirements that I
mentioned earlier, after the minor victory of getting the business
analyst to sit with the team, I then suggested that we start to have
"show and tell" meetings. This was a fraud detection project. Fraud
was an issue that affected people who worked for the bank, and their
customers, all over the world. So, for the first phone conference, I
could hear just from the accents, the wide geographical spread of
interest. We were sitting in an office in central London. But on the
phone, there were Northern Irish accents and Scottish accents. There
were also Cockney-sounding Southend accents and accents from the
offshore call centres in India.

In that week, the team had been doing some work on the user interface
for one of the very early screens in one of the fraud reporting
journeys.

A developer put up the first screen in the journey. She started to talk
it through. Even though most people who were on the conference call were
on mute, I thought I detected a change in the silence. Finally, someone
on the line with a cockney accent said:

"Erm, I thought we'd agreed that we were going to arrange cases by
account name rather than by account number?"

The developer who was demonstrating the screen looked blank and slightly
panicked. The business analyst who we'd only just set eyes on and had
only just joined the team started to look worried and scroll wildly
through the requirements document.

"No, it's in the requirements that cases should be arranged by account
number."

"But that makes no sense" someone with a Northern Irish accent joined
in.

"It's people who are victims of fraud, not just individual accounts,"
added someone with a Glaswegian accent.

"We need to see all the accounts that a customer has. And we need to
see the activity across all of their accounts, for this screen to make
any sense," said another voice with an accent I didn't recognise.

Yes, that's right. The structure of this project was wrong from the
very beginning. This problem hadn't been detected through months and
months of analysis. But it took just five minutes of putting the working
software (OK, I'll admit, it was only a clickable GUI) in front of the
people who might use it to find the problem.

If you do stand-ups every working day with your team, if you do
retrospectives and show and tells every sprint, you will find out what
the problems are. Even if you do these things relatively - you will
still find out what the problems are. Not having stand-ups, not having
retrospectives and show and tells is just like shouting "Scrub the
decks, don't look at the pirate ship!" at your team.

So, what does this idea of "agreed activity" mean for our overall aim
of delivering the impossible?

Well, it means something simple. If you work to discover the problems
that your project is facing you will find them. If you then work to
solve those problems, you may well be able to transform projects that
seem impossible into projects that are possible. This gives you the best
chance of delivering them.

This seems so obvious as to be laughable. Why then, in project after
project, have I found teams that aren't articulating their problems and
aren't tackling them? In improv terms the teams aren't looking at the
pirate ship. Why? Why aren't they doing what needs to be done before
the trouble they can see coming arrives? Why are they washing the decks?
Why are they making potentially entertaining improv shows boring? The
same way of behaving occurs in software development. It's a way of
behaving that makes challenging-but-possible projects impossible to
deliver.

Why? Because problems are scary. Problems are humbling. Problems cause
the ways in which people don't agree to come to light. Professional
people who are hired to do a job are supposed to be able to do it,
aren't they? What does it mean if they openly admit that there are
parts of a job that they can't do? Maybe it means that someone hired
the wrong people.

Highlighting the problems that a project throws up can be threatening to
the senior people involved in that project. What if the problem that
comes to light is something that they haven't thought of and they
don't know how to fix? They will be inclined to avoid addressing it,
possibly by attacking or threatening the team for daring to raise the
issue.

In software development, members of development teams do the right thing
and point out the problems that they see on the horizon. They do the
equivalent of shouting "Look, a pirate ship!" all the time. But
unfortunately, the response of the of senior people who should
acknowledge these problems and the thank the people who point them out
is something like "You're wrong, it's not there."

Other ways of responding that are just as bad are "I'm tired of this
negativity," or "Maybe you're not up to the job if you think that's
a pirate ship." And that's the main reason that ships and projects
sink.

And that's why people don't raise problems and instead just wash the
decks.

But why? Why would the people who want a project to succeed most be the
very people who put it at most risk by not acknowledging the problems
that need to be solved when they arise.

In recent years, the concept of psychological safety has been developed
and popularised. It states in a more formal way something that we
already really knew. Safety isn't just about physical safety. We also
need psychological safety and when we don't have it, we will change our
position and behaviour until we do.

Psychological safety imagines that there are four basic levels of safety
that sit one on top of the other.

Level 1 is being allowed in the group - inclusion safety.

Level 2 is being allowed to learn in the group - learning safety.

Level 3 is being allowed to contribute to the group - contribution
safety.

Level 4 is being allowed to challenge what the group are doing -
challenger safety.

These ideas, that Timothy R Clark outlines in his book *The 4 Stages of
Psychological Safety* are very useful. As a first step, it's good to
understand that one stage of psychological safety needs to be built on
top of another. And, from the point of view of our metaphor of the
pirate ship, we can see that we need to be at the top of this staircase,
all the way up at level 4, before, as a crew member, we can comfortably
shout "Hey look! A pirate ship."

For Clark, fostering psychological safety in creative teams is about
trying to do two things at the same time. In a creative, problem-solving
team, we need disagreements, we need different ideas. As Clark puts it,
we need increasing intellectual friction. But at the same time, we
don't want to spend all our time falling out and storming off. Again,
as Clark puts it, we need to be decreasing social friction.

This is something that I've been struggling with since I've been a
project manager. When I'm working with a team, I find myself very often
having to point out that there are disagreements and reassuring the team
that this is OK.

This connects with another idea that Clark discusses - the idea that
psychological safety is about a relationship between cover and candour.
The more reassurance that the leader of a team can provide that there
won't be any negative effects for being honest, the more honest team
members will be. The more cover the leader provides, the more candour
she will get from her team.

But there are two issues I have with the idea of fostering psychological
safety as a full solution to the problem of the pirate ship. Firstly,
real creative situations often aren't psychologically safe - and they
never are going to be. There is always going to be a potential conflict
between doing the right thing in terms of pointing out the pirate ship
and being safe. If you point out the pirate ship, you run the risk of
not only being shouted down or ignored, but even possibly kicked out of
the team.

Second, there's someone missing from it. The boss. Yes, increasing
psychological safety for the team makes it more likely that the team
will contribute and challenge. But what about the boss? Is she part of
the team? Or is she part of an entirely different organisational setup?
What is her role in *that* team? Is she trying to get her feet under
the table and just get "member safety?" Is she trying to learn the
ropes? Or is she really at the point where she can say to other people
in her peer group, "My team have identified this problem. It's
something all your teams must also be experiencing. I'm surprised you
haven't mentioned it. We need to fix it." What if your boss doesn't
have challenger safety in the group that she's in? If she isn't at the
point where she can say things like that in whatever forum she operates
in, then we have a problem.

This is the idea. The boss is in a different team, and in that team,
they might not be, probably won't be, the boss. This helps explain
something that I'd known for a long time but hadn't completely
understood. It's what the writer Robert Anton Wilson calls "the SNAFU
principle."

>> Adequate communication flows freely between equals. Communication
between non-equals is warped and distorted by second-circuit Domination
and Submission rituals perpetuating communication jam and a Game Without
End (From Robert Anton Wilson, *Prometheus Rising*).

What does this mean? It means that even though it's the right thing to
do, to avoid agreed activity, it's absolutely right for members of a
team to point out problems, to stop mopping the deck and point out the
pirate ship. Even though this is what a team needs to do to be
successful, what happens as a result of acknowledging the problems, is
always going to be vulnerable to being warped and distorted by whatever
power structures the boss is involved in.

To explore this a little bit more, it might be useful at this point
toput the metaphor of the pirate ship aside and concentrate on the real
problem of software development. What actual bad news might you need to
communicate to a boss? Here are some examples, starting with the most
common.

"There's no way that this project is going to deliver for the proposed
deadline." This is of course, the absolutely classic, that in some form
comes up in almost every project. But here are some others which are
also very common.

"This project is entirely dependent on Department X's system Q being
ready. We just talked to someone from Department X, system Q doesn't
exist."

"What we're doing is probably illegal. We'd need to spend at least
six months thrashing out what we can and can't do with the regulatory
authorities."

"The people who can tell us how this system is supposed to work won't
talk to us, or can't talk to us, or don't exist."

"My team don't have access to (one or more of) internet connectivity,
computers, desks, toilets."

"You aren't paying us."

"We showed this interface to some potential users, and they hated it."

These are real common problems and these are problems that we can't fix.
We need to discuss them with the boss, we need the bosses help to get
them fixed.

When we're doing this, it's extremely useful to understand that the
boss might be in a team where she doesn't have psychological safety and
that may lead her to not be in a position, psychologically, to
acknowledge, let alone deal with the problems that we're bringing to
light. But now what do we do?

This again reminds me of some of the ideas that I've come across in
improvisational theatre, and especially in Keith Johnstone's book
*Impro*.

Johnstone had been trying to get the students that he was working with
to have natural-sounding conversations on stage. He'd tried all kinds
of things and hadn't managed to get anything to work. Finally, after
another day of struggling, he went home and turned on the TV. There was
a programme by the biologist and writer Desmond Morris. Morris was
talking about a community of chimps. He explained that pretty much
everything that chimps do - who they sit with, who they eat with, who
they have sex with, can be explained as a status transaction. When one
chimp grooms another, the chimp that is doing the grooming is affirming
that they are lower in status than the chimp that gets groomed.

The point that Morris made in the TV programme was that most of these
status exchanges aren't huge. There are very few fights involved. There
isn't much chest beating. The status exchanges are tiny, fractional
indications of who is higher and lower status. Who sits highest on the
tree? Who is has their hair picked for fleas first when two near equals
agree to pick through each other's fur? How these questions are answered
show the precise status of all the chimps in the group

The next day, Johnstone went back to his studio and asked his students
to improvise scenes. He had only one instruction for his students.
Whatever one person said, the other person should try to lift
themselves, or lower themselves, just slightly, in status with their
reply.

Johnstone was delighted with the results. Suddenly, his students were
having conversations that sounded like the way people normally talked.

"Are you going anywhere nice on your holidays?"

"Tahiti."

"Ooh, that sounds amazing, I'd love to go to Tahiti."

"Well, my husband is working out in the South Pacific, so it's easiest
if I go out and holiday near where he is. Are you going anywhere nice?"

"Ibiza."

"Oh! I love Ibiza. We used to go there all the time before we had
kids."

"It's my first time."

"Oh, I'm sure you'll love it."

OK - now read this again. Who is high status? And what does the
high-status person do to (slightly) lower their status? Does this sound
like a realistic conversation?

Think of a conversation that you've had recently with a friend of a
colleague. Who was lower status (just fractionally) who was higher
status.

Now let's come back to the business of bad news and taking problems to
the boss. The difficulty that project managers are always wrestling with
is that bad news is humbling. The giving and receiving of bad news is a
status transaction. Johnstone's insight (and Robert Anton Wilson's as
well) is that in real life nearly everything is a status transaction.
But this makes life really difficult for project managers and also for
their bosses. But it explains a lot of the negative and unhelpful
behaviour that we see from bosses when they get bad news. It also
explains why so many teams recognise the bad news and then tell nobody
about it.

Why do kings shoot the messenger? Because in that moment when the
messenger arrives and spills the bad news, the messenger is lowering the
status of the king. This is intolerable for the king. And in that
moment, he can easily solve the status problem. Sure, the battle is
lost. But to recover his status and show that he's still the king, he
can have the messenger shot. So, guess what happens a lot of the time

What we've established from the beginning of this chapter is that if
you don't tackle the pirate ships that you see on the horizon, your
project will be a disaster. What we've also established is that the
people who came up with the idea for a project will always be resistant
to your spotting of the pirate ships. As a project manager, you might
see your main job as managing this contradiction.

If we all wait until we aren't scared to start tackling the pirate
ship, the pirates will already have boarded and we'll be walking the
plank. If we're working on the team, or if we're managing the team, we
need to act, even when we're afraid.

Timothy R Clark points out this important difference. Social friction is
going to happen - arguments, fall outs are going to happen. But too much
is bad for a team. It's better if the team gets along. But another kind
of friction is also going to happen. It's the kind of friction that
comes from people seeing a situation differently based on their
experience. This is friction caused by differences of opinion. In new
situations, when dealing with new problems, we need this. We have to
expect disagreements, we have to be comfortable with different points of
view. Managing the psychological safety of a team is about allowing
intellectual friction. At the same time, we need to ease social
friction.

But he also points out the importance of a trade-off between cover and
candour. If we're one of the bosses, it's our job to reward courage.
What's courage? It's doing the right thing, in spite of our fears and
providing cover for candour. And in turn, that requires courage on our
part as bosses, because *our* bosses might not like the truth either.

And here it comes. The admission. I think I messedthis up for most of my
career as a project manager.

How? I think sometimes I've been unaware of this status transaction.
And I think sometimes, I've mistakenly thought that I can exploit it.
That I can raise my stature relative to my boss by pointing to the bad
news. This has never turned out well. This is a bit of a revelation for
me, just now, writing this book. The challenge is to point to the pirate
ship on the horizon and tackle it. What makes this even more of a
challenge is to find a way of doing that that doesn't undermine the
bosses. This is my revelation. If you're trying to use the fact that
you've spotted this problem as a way of elevating your own status,
things will go very badly indeed.

I've spent most of my career as a project manager pointing out the
pirate ships. I'm not brave. But I am clear that *not* pointing out
the pirate ships and not dealing with them will not work as a strategy.
Once you've realised this - that keeping quiet when you see a problem
is going to sink a project - it no longer becomes a real option.

But still, you have to find a way of bringing up these problems that
doesn't attack the status of your boss. This seems to be a variation on
the idea - nobody seems to be entirely sure where the quote originates -
"Culture eats strategy for breakfast."

Another way of thinking this (I wish I had known this 10 or 15 years
ago) is this.

>> If you try to use the severity of the situation as a way of
challenging the hierarchy, the hierarchy will win, no matter what the
cost to the organisation. Even if it means that the project will fail.

When you're looking at project management methodologies, it's worth
looking for the ones that *do* publicise trouble. For me the one that
does this most is Scrum. Another method that shows up where there are
problems is Kanban. Kanban's idea of visualising the work in progress,
and where it is in the process is extremely powerful. Scrum is good at
throwing up problems like "We can't access the office" or "The
database that we're supposed to interface with doesn't exist." Kanban
is good at throwing up problems like "Half the work in the system is
waiting for answers to questions from a senior stakeholder." Most
commonly, Kanban also shows "Work is taking so long to get from start
to finish because there is just too much work in the system."

As we discussed in the introduction, there is a good chance that you
picked this book up because you wanted to deliver what seems to be an
impossible project. And in this chapter, I think I've given you an
important way of seeing projects that will help with this. Find the big
problems that everyone is ignoring and, with the help of the team,
tackle them. I think I've also explained why the team, and why the
bosses might be ignoring those problems. Because they don't feel safe.
Because they might have to change. Because they might have to think.

I'm keeping my word. But notice I'm not saying that I'll show you how
delivering these projects is a walk in the park or a day at the beach.
It might not be.

In conclusion then, what should you do? Well, if you're the project
manager on a project, you should look for agreed activity. When you find
it, you should look for the pirate ships, the real problems that this
low conflict, low impact work is hiding.

When you find the pirate ships, you need to fix what you can in the
team. But you also need to find ways of bringing these problems to the
attention of your boss in a way that doesn't threaten their status, and
perhaps even enhances it.

Dealing with the problems that you find and making them clear to your
team and your sponsors can be a rough ride. It can be hard to stick to
it. It needs an ability to talk about the real problems. It also needs
the ability to be understanding when people call you names. They will
call you "Negative," or "pessimist," or "unprofessional." Even if
they aren't likely to actually shoot you. But there are two good
reasons why you still should do it.

Reason number one is that solving these problems is still the best
chance you've got of delivering this project. Spotting the pirate ships
and avoiding agreed activity is the single best way of making a project
possible. Making it possible rather than impossible. That is a solid and
compelling reason.

But reason number two is possibly for me, just as important: I know what
happens when you don't and that's what we'll look at in the next
chapter.

## Chapter SHIP2 -- Tackling the pirate ship
==============================================

We've acknowledged that ignoring the pirate ship is a bad idea. We've established that we're an authority on the problem? But what about the solution? Once you've spotted the ship on the horizon, what do you do about it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Connections

I think I made it pretty clear in the chapter on agreed activity and the
pirate ship, that it's very important to deal with the pirate ship.
Let's just be clear again what the pirate ship is. It is the problem
that everyone can see on the horizon that nobody wants to deal with.

What I didn't really address in that chapter is how to deal with the
pirate ship. Why? Well, here's the main reason. Most of the problems
that software development projects encounter are easy for someone to
solve. They are mostly of the kind that I call "Bricks without straw"
problems. And there is an obvious solution to them. What do I mean by
"Bricks without straw" problems?

Here are some examples.

* The wifi in the office doesn't work.

* The people that we need to talk to so we can find out what the
software should do, refuse to talk to us.

* The list of things that need to be done by the deadline can't be
done by the deadline.

Most of the time these kinds of "bricks without straw" problems can be
solved. If they are made clear to someone who has the capability to fix
them, they can be solved relatively easily. Someone has sufficient
seniority to call the company that is providing the wifi and internet
access and get it fixed. Someone is senior enough to email the subject
matter experts and tell them that they should make time to talk to the
development team. Even to make the tough decisions that need to be made
to either reduce the scope that needs to be delivered for the deadline,
or change the deadline.

But this is a bit of an Agile dirty secret. Yes, Agile has a focus on
using transparency to fix problems. And yes, it's really effective as a
way of fixing a lot of problems. But there comes a point when you've
fixed all the problems that can be fixed. For a lot of problems, simply
giving them enough air, daylight, and publicity works. They get fixed.
But then, guess what you're left with? Yes, that's right.

The problems that you can't fix.

Some problems are hard. Some problems are hard because their solution
would require innovation - a new answer that nobody has tried before.
Some problems are hard because they are inherent contradictions - they
don't have a solution. They can't be solved, they can only be managed.
And many problems are hard because it's not clear whether they have a
solution and we need to look for it, or they don't and we just need to
manage them.

### Concrete practice

It is worth asking, what would a solution *look* like. What *kind*
of thing would be a solution.

Is it a technology? Is it a relationship? Is it a form of communication?

Another thing to think about is the dynamic of the problem. Is there a
threshold beyond which this won't be a problem anymore? For example,
how fast would the internet connection have to be for a developer in the
office before it ceased to be a problem? How infrequent would outages
have to be before they stopped being a problem?

Let's say that we commit to a course of action to improve something. We
agree to push to get access to the people we need to talk to. How long
is that likely to take? How long will it take for us to feel the
benefits. Some kinds of capability take months, or years to develop.

Do a bunch of things need to happen, together, or in sequence, for this
to get better?

A lot of the problems that we encounter in project management are
trade-offs. There are lots of trade-offs in software development with
speed. Speed is traded off against accuracy. You can have something
fast, but it might not be exactly right. Speed is also traded off
against something called "tech debt." Tech debt is the difference
between doing something fast and and doing something "right." Where
"right" means tidily and in a way that might make sense to other
people.

Speed of development is also, of course, traded off against security.
But speed can also be traded off against things we might think are
unreservedly good. An example? User research is great, understanding the
swamp and the denizens of the swamp is vital. But at some point you have
to start writing some software.

### Concept

Congratulations. You have solved all the easily solved problems. You
have pointed out the pirate ships. Now you've hit bedrock.

### Conclusion

What kind of problems might the "pirate ship" metaphor represent? When
we start to list the kinds of problems, we get more understanding of why
people instinctively avoid them. The pirate ship might be a relatively
straightforward "Bricks without straw" problem. These are just very
frustrating for the teams who have to labour under them. And they are
often embarrassing for the senior people who need to get them fixed. But
they can be fixed.

But some other problems are just downright *hard*. What's the right
trade-off between the complexity of the software and maintainability?
What signs should we look for to know that we're adding too much
functionality too quickly? Or even what signs might we see that suggest
we're not being adventurous enough and we need to go faster?

Well, then we can actually start to build something that is valuable to
its users and valuable to the people who paid for it. And when you get
to that stage, what you needs as well as general ideas is technique. How
do you run a project using the principles of empirical control?

How do you make sure that the "pirate ship" whatever it is, is front and
centre and being address by both the team and the stakeholders? How do
you involve the users at every stage of the project? This is what we're
going to talk about in the next chapter.

So the book up to now, been how to look at a project strategically. How
do you deal with a project that seems to be impossible? You look at it
from the point of view of a crew on a ship. Where are you scrubbing the
decks in some kind of agreed activity? What pirate ships are there on
the horizon that you aren't dealing with. You find the agreed activity
in your team and disrupt it.You help your team, you help your
stakeholders to focus on the problems in front of them.

And a good way to think of those problems is as the exploration of a
swamp. It has submerged dangers and opportunities. It has a ton of
people who are interested in what goes on there, from different points
of view. It isn't a known quantity. If it were, it wouldn't have
required an expensive and risky project to explore it.

When do we listen to the people of the swamp? When do we ignore them?
When do we decide that we've done enough talking and we have to start
building something? Getting that right is the result of experience and
technique.

## Chapter STREAMS-- Flowers and fruit. Two different value streams and an awkward phase in the middle.
=========================================================================================================

There are some things in life that we're immediately attracted to, without thinking. There are some things which are valuable but require work. The problem with and the challenge of, project management, is that we need to move from the idea to a reality. The idea is immediately attractive - like a flower. But the reality, which does you good, like fruit, requires effort to cultivate. This move from flowers to fruit is fraught with difficulty. One way of understanding this and knowing what to do about it is by using the idea of "value streams."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, I'm going to talk a lot about "value streams". And
also, about "flowers" and "fruit". Of course, of those terms, "value
stream" is probably the less familiar. So, I'll try to explain value
streams first.

Value streams are often talked about with regard to "Lean" approaches to
manufacturing. And what are they exactly? In the mid 1970's there was an
energy crisis, oil prices were high. American car manufacturing started
to lose out to the Japanese. Japanese cars were more reliable, cheaper
and far more fuel efficient than American cars. In many ways, Japanese
cars were just better.

Researchers from the business schools in America began to write about
*why* Japanese made better cars than than the Americans. A key idea in
explaining why Japanese industry, and especially the Toyota car company
had become so successful was the idea of the "value stream". And
together with the idea of a value stream came a very specific notion of
waste.

A value stream is a series of actions that culminate in the production
of a product that's valuable to its customers. So, as the chassis of a
car moves down a production line, value gets added to it. What sorts of
things add value? Well, in the case of a car, an engine. An engine adds
value. Paint, wing mirrors, seats. You get the idea. But note, none of
this value gets realised until the car is finally being driven.

American observers also drew attention to the Japanese understanding of
what *didn't* add value. Activities that are going on in a factory
that don't contribute to the value stream are regarded as waste. There's
an example in Taiichi Ohno's book, "The Toyota Production System". There
is a machine that is part of the production line that needs to be
changed when a different model of car is made. All of the time that it
takes to swap the machine, is, from the point of view of a value stream,
waste. This seems easy to understand. But there are other kinds of waste
that Taiichi Ohno identified at Toyota which perhaps aren't so
intuitive. If completed cars, having rolled off the production line, are
waiting around in a yard, they aren't delivering any value. That's also
waste. If parts are stacked high in warehouses and for long periods of
time aren't being added to any car -- that's also waste.

This is a final crucial aspect of thinking about value streams. The
value is only realised when the product that has been through the
production line, is actually sold and delivered into the hands of a
customer.

This investigation of how the Japanese made cars resulted in at least
three interesting ideas.

1.  The manufacturer of a product can be arranged into a series of value
    adding steps.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Any waiting around between these value adding steps is waste.

2.  Any waiting around before the final step of getting the product to
    the people who use it, that's also waste.

These ideas were interesting to a lot of people. They offered a
suggestion for how any organisation might improve its process and make
it more efficient. Although this is quite a leap. Not all organisations,
you might have noticed, make cars.

And one main idea came out of these discussions. It's possibly to map a
value stream. It's possibly to see what all the steps in a process are.
So then, it's possible to see where there are delays and where there is
"waste". Once you've found where the waste is, you can work to reduce
it. From this way of thinking, comes a whole new way of organising many
industries and the notion of "Just in time" manufacturing.

You might be able to see the appeal of looking at work in this way. If
we can map the value stream we can reduce waste between processes. We
can especially look at reducing waiting times. Then we can notionally
speed up any production process and make it more efficient.

So, there it is, that's the idea of a value stream. A series of steps
that add value to a product. And people have made good solid efforts to
apply these ideas to software development. Some of these attempts work
[Ref: Poppendiek] and some really don't. We'll talk about where these
ideas are exceptionally useful in a following chapter [Chapter
ESCAPE].

But right now, I'm going to take this idea of value streams and stretch
it in a couple of directions. Because, I'm going to argue, that when it
comes to development of software for a new product, there isn't just one
value stream. There are (at least) two value streams. A further
complication is that, at the beginning of a project, of these two
streams, one of them doesn't exist (yet) and the other is opaque and
weird. Oh, and there's a final complication: the two value streams in
software product development interfere with each other. And when I say
"interfere" I mean that they try to kill each other, and will actually
do that, if you don't manage to stop them,

So, what are these two value streams? The first of these streams is what
I'm going to call the "virtual" value stream. This is a stream that
delivers value by looking good, sounding good, or by coming up with a
new, attractive, idea. The payoff for this value stream, is in the
funding and institutional support that arrives to make the idea happen.
It's also in an increase in reputation and standing of the people who
came up with the idea or the people who manage to take credit for it.

Is this really a value stream? In some sense, it must be. Ideas don't
just instantly appear fully formed and projects don't just instantly
get funded. So, there must be a value stream here. But quite how it
works in most organisations is opaque, which is why I say that it's
weird. We will talk more about this stream a bit later. For now, I want
to move on to the other stream in software development projects, the one
that, at the start at least, doesn't exist.

The second stream is the one I'm going to call the "virtuous" value
stream. This is the stream that delivers value, not by looking good, or
sounding like a good idea, but by actually *doing* good. "Doing good"
means delivering something that is valuable to the people who use it.

Because "virtual" and "virtuous" sound a bit alike. I'm also going to
borrow (I already have) an idea from Taoist thinking. This is the
distinction between flowers and fruit. The virtual value stream is like
flowers. The virtuous value stream is like fruit.

Don't get me wrong. It might seem as we go through this chapter that
I'm a little bit down on flowers. I'm not down on flowers. Flowers are
great. In project management, the part of flowers is played by ideas and
dreams. Without ideas there wouldn't be any projects.

People have ideas, those ideas get money and support and that's how
projects are born. Something that some ideas and most flowers have in
common is that people like them straight away. They don't have to think
about it. They have some attributes that are instantly attractive. It
doesn't take any thought to like a rose. Of course, some people might
not like roses. But the people who do? They don't have to take time to
work it out.

Something similar seems to happen with ideas. The kind of ideas that get
money to turn into projects seem to have a structure that makes people
like them without too much thought. Just like flowers, those who are
exposed to them tend to like them without doing much or any thinking.

Often ideas are talked about in these terms: easy, fast or cheap. Other
times, the idea's appeal is that some things won't change:

"It will be fully-compatible," or "will have the same functionality."

Sometimes the idea's appeal is difference:

"A fresh look," or "A different take."

Sometimes all of these things get bundled together.

"A radically different take which does exactly what the old system did,
but faster, quicker, more easily and for less money."

And of course, all of this, almost always, is going to be delivered
using the latest technology.

"Does everything that the old system does, but quicker and cheaper and
using AI."

"Deals with all customer enquiries, using chatbots without the need for
human involvement."

"A social network, for dogs, using blockchain"

This "instant appeal" aspect of ideas is a substantial part of why I say
that the virtual value stream is weird. Yes, there might be an
application process for getting ideas funded, and, as I said, earlier,
there must be some steps to the process. But there might just as well
not be, this could just be the idea of someone really senior, or someone
who has the really senior person's ear. Some projects get funded on a
whim. Maybe no one in the organisation has *any* idea why they're
doing this. Maybe another organisation is doing it, and they just have a
strong inclination to do whatever they do. And even if there is a more
involved process, at some point, the central proposal of the project is
going to be evaluated. And then, the mechanism of how an idea appeals to
the people s going to be vaugue.

Even though the appeal of ideas might not have any obvious logic to it.
From the examples I've given, we might see that are some common themes
in the ideas that get funded. Ideas that get funded often have these
concepts lurking in them -- "all", "same" but also "new".

Where ideas come from is a fascinating subject but I'm going to
side-step it for now. Because the whole point of this chapter is that,
for a project to deliver, it needs to stop being fascinated by the idea.
Rather, it it needs to start being fascinated by the reality. We need to
stop smelling the flowers think about how we're going to grow the
fruit.

And there's an important difference between Flowers and fruit. Users eat
fruit. They only look at flowers. Nobody ever died from looking at a
flower (probably). A sour apple can give you bad indigestion and some
fruit is actually poisonous. A *lot* of fruit is either poisonous or
unpalatable until it's been properly processed.

Similarly, delivered projects need to give value to their users. This
involves an interaction with users which is different from looking at,
or smelling, flowers. Users have to get some good, some value out of
using a software product. What 'good' that value is, is different for
different kinds of products. For example, it's very different for a
social media product than it is for a government form. But like fruit,
if it doesn't taste right, users will spit it out. Also like fruit, if
software isn't put together (grown) properly, it could do them harm.

So, what about fruit? What about this other value stream - the virtuous
value stream? The one that actually gives people what they want? In the
Toyota product system mentioned above, this second value stream is the
focus of all the attention. In fact, it's talked about as if it's the
only value stream. Taiichi Ohno is always asking "How can we improve
flow through the system," and "How can we get parts to the right place
in the process just in time."

There is an aspect of this that often gets missed when people try to
transfer these ideas to the development of software. Most software
development projects are developing a new product. The problem that
they're trying to solve isn't one of trying to make a better car. Toyota
didn't invent cars. Our problem is like it would be if *nobody* had
ever made a car. Our product is a new product, it's a one-off, nobody
has ever made one exactly like this before.

Am I exaggerating? I'm exaggerating a little bit. It's more like you and
your team are trying to build a new kind of vehicle. If you're building
a video game, well there have been video games before. But you're still
going to need to take aspects of the idea and find out which bits users
respond to. And then you're going to need to connect them together in a
game that they want to buy and spend hours playing. If you're building a
form-filling application, well, there have been those too. But you're
still going to need to understand what information you need to gather.
You need to understand what the best way is to ask for the information.
Then, when you've got the information, you need to know how it's going
to be stored and who's going to want to look at it. The important thing
to understand and admit is that you're in a *prototyping* process, not
a manufacturing process. You're assembling (irrigating?) a value stream,
not operating or improving an existing one.

So how do you do this? How do put together the value adding steps that
will eventually deliver something that realises value for the customer?

Well, you have to do two things.

1.  Discover value -- explore and find out what the potential users of
    this product might want.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Construct a value stream-- try to put together some software in an
    application that can deliver these values.

In the next chapter [Chapter Swamp] we'll talk about why, how and with
whom, you should work to discover value. Then in the chapter after that
[Chapter ESCAPE], we'll talk about how to put these bits of value
together and start a value stream.

Simple right? Well, it would be, if it weren't for a third thing that
you have to do. As a result of these two steps.

3.  Deal with all the flack and fallout that comes from discovering
    value and constructing a value stream.

This the central paradox of project management. Starting to do the
project results in the alienation of the people who got the project
funded. Why? Because actually doing things results in uncovering
problems. Doing things also inherently involves the risk of making
mistakes. By trying to implement the idea, you undermine the idea.

This is especially true of using an Agile approach to software
development, particularly a Scrum approach. In Scrum, every day, the
team have an opportunity to report any problems that they're finding in
their attempt to realise the dream, the idea that has been funded. Add
into this mix user researchers who are talking to the users about their
needs - and we should add them. Then, pretty soon after the project
starts, you start to get a picture of what users think of the idea.
Maybe they love it, maybe they hate it, maybe they think about it in a
way that is totally unreasonable. Maybe they point out a really good
reason why it won't work. They think about it in a way that you really
didn't anticipate.

That's the thing. However, users think about it doesn't really matter.
What matters is that it's almost guaranteed that they way that they
think about it won't exactly the same as the people who had the idea.
And to them -- the "keepers" of the idea - unless they have deep and
strong experience in product management and development, this is going
to appear as a threat.

And this is a sticky, difficult, delicate and business. And we're going
look at it from a series of different points of views in the hope of
getting a smarter way of looking at it [Chapter CHAOS, Chapter
CONVERSATION]. But it's always going to be tricky. On the one side we
have the dreams, on the other side, where we're headed, is a value
stream. But it's a value stream that, if it delivers at all, will
deliver something that is slightly different from the dream. The
reality, if it's to be a success, will be something that is intimately
involved with users. It will engage with their enthusiasms, capabilities
and limitations. It also, if it's got a chance of success, it should
also address the interests and concerns of lots of other stakeholders.
Regulators and spectators and possibly investors will also be
interested, as well as the people who came up with the idea.

Note that this is a vision of a project as a balancing act dreams and
reality. One the one hand are the dreams of the people who had the idea
and funded it. On the other hand are the wants and needs of the people
who experience the reality. And between these two is a hard place. This
is where support from the people who had the idea is running out and
support for them people who will benefit from the reality hasn't
started. This isn't exactly a "standard" view of project management.

But it is a standard account of something else. Stories and adventures.

In a lot of adventures, the hero has a dream, a vision. Or there's
always been a dream hanging around (a prophecy?). The hero has no real
idea how they're going to realise that vision. But, after some
reluctance, set off to try any way. On the way, they find things (a
sword, a statue, some writing on a wall). people tell them things (an
old man in the forest points in a certain direction). And then they
start to get a better picture of what their quest might actually be
about. They have lots of struggles, setback. They think about giving up.
But they don't. In a final scene, they put all of these things together,
save the day and win the prize. Then they go home for whatever is the
nicest meal possible, in that time period, on that planet, and in that
culture.

If you're trying to deliver a project, you're on that kind of adventure.
You might not be comforted to hear this. And weirdly neither are the
people who had the original idea for the project. The people who funding
the project - they probably won't be that pleased either. But that's
where you are. The idea was just the start. Someone has to head out on
that journey. You have to find what's valuable. You have to find the
jewel, the chalice and the sword. Then you have to throw those things
that you found into the fire in the temple in the right order. Then and
only then can you save the world and go home for tea.

How does this help? How does seeing a project in these terms make
"delivering the impossible" any easier. Remember the quote from Alan
Kay? "Point of view is worth 90 IQ points."

I believe that thinking of a project in terms of value streams is a
interesting and different point of view. One value stream is a virtual
one. It deals in dreams. The other is a virtuous one. It needs to be
built through course of the project. I think this point of view does
make it easier to understand what's actually going on in a project. For
example, this view of a project explains the team's reluctance to tackle
the pirate ship that we talk about in [Chapter SHIP]. Why don't the
team want to tackle the pirate ship? They don't want to go on the
adventure! And why would they? Adventures are dangerous and uncertain.
Especially, if the captain has said that this shouldn't be an adventure,
that he doesn't want to hear about anything going wrong, they won't want
to go. The leader might not have said anything said anything. Maybe
they're just relying on intuition. The leader's feeling about taking
risks was shown by the way they reacted to even the tiniest thing going
wrong.

In order to go an adventure, a team need encouragement and support and
someone who knows the kinds of things they should being doing. They need
someone who is prepared to go with them and give them encouragement.
They want someone to acknowledge their struggles and try to give them
the best chance of success -- that's you!

Taking this point of view, of a project as the construction of a path
through a wild and unknown space, helps. It helps with one of the major
causes of feeling bad for any project manager - the idea of commitment
and consistency.

The thing that gets a project funded is an idea. The aspects of an idea
that get ideas funded aren't very closely, if at all, connected with
their deliverability. Rather they're very closely connected with a
certain kind of "shiny" simplification. Word and phrases like "new",
"fast", "just like the old system, but better", "Using AI and
blockchain." to some people, have a flower like appeal. They don't need
to think about why they like them. When you understand this, you start
to realise that all a funded project is, is pointing in a certain
direction. Nobody knows *exactly* what you're going to find there.
Nobody knows if you're going to be able to put together what you find
there and get it to deliver value. If you're the project manager of this
"gesture in a certain direction" that's got funding and resources, what
can you possibly promise? What can you possibly commit to? How can you
be consistent?

This isn't a rhetorical question. There are a bunch of things can
commit. You can commit to going on the journey and taking the team with
you. You can commit to doing all you can, as a team, to explore the area
that the project points to. This is the "swamp" that we'll talk about in
the next chapter. And you can commit to finding what's useful, valuable
and attractive there [Chapter SWAMP]. You can commit to putting
together a prototype value stream that connects these values together to
deliver that value as soon as you possibly can. That's what working
software is, and we'll be talking about it in [Chapter ESCAPE].

When you start to look at projects in this way there is both good news
and bad news. The bad news is that for almost all projects you have to
go on the adventure. There is no way of taking the idea, the thing that
got funded through the "virtual value stream", and just implementing it.
There is almost never enough detail in the idea. In fact, lack of detail
is probably part of the idea's appeal. And then there's even more bad
news. The only way to realise the idea, is to substantially explore the
area that it points at. But then, having explored, you need to decide
which of the things you find are valuable. Then, of valuable things
you've found, you and your team need to decide which of those things
you're going to put together to form a value stream. Finally, you have
to build that value stream. That's a lot of work. And it's work that has
to be done whilst somehow not upsetting the people who had the idea.

So, lots of bad news. Is there any good news? Well yes, there is good
news. If you follow this approach, you will have given yourself and the
people you work for, the best chance of delivering that they can have.
You will have given yourself a chance of success, even on the most
impossible-sounding projects. Looking at projects in this way, might
just give you the bump of 90 IQ points that Alan Kay talked about. It
helps you know what you're doing. Why are you doing user research?
Because that's how we discover values. Why are you putting together
working software and putting it in the hands of users? Because that's
how we take the values that we've uncovered and start to put them
together into a value stream. And that can deliver on almost any
project, no matter how crazy the idea sounds.

Finally, there's one bit of news that you could get, that doesn't come
to every project, but when it does, it's really good news.

This is something that comes from the infamous veteran sales copywriter
Gary Halbert. Halbert wrote one book -- and he wrote it from jail where
he was serving time connected with something he'd written in some sales
copy. Gary Halbert tells a story of a question that he asks people who
come along to his copy writing courses. He sets the scene. These aren't
the exact words. But this is the drift: "You're going to have a
hamburger stand, and I'm going to have a hamburger stand. You can have
anything you want to make your hamburgers sell and I'm going to have
just one thing, and I'm going to beat you every time."

Of course, his students now play what we'd recognise as the "Hipster"
burger game. "Kobe beef", "sour dough bread" and "Ethical meat grown in
a lab." Lots of fancy features on the product. Or they go the "super
value" way -- "buy one, get one free."

Then Gary Halbert tells his students the thing that he's going to have
that's going to mean his burger stand is more successful than theirs --
a hungry crowd.

A hungry crowd.

This applies to burgers, and it applies to software product development.
If you have a hungry crowd, that's the best bit of news you can possibly
get. If the organisation that is paying you to deliver this project
really, really needs this project to be delivered, that is a huge
benefit. Even better is if the users of the product really need it to be
delivered. In my experience, when an organisation is desperate for a
piece of software, they will tolerate the kind of approaches that we've
talked about. They will allow user research, they will allow early
release of working software. Notice I say "tolerate," and "allow".
That's a lot different from "enthusiastically support."

So, there's a simpler idea, past all the talk of fruit and flowers,
virtual and virtuous value streamsr. A simpler way of seeing projects
and seeing what you're doing when you're managing them. And this is in
terms of push and pull. Ideas are push. A hungry crowd is pull. Ideas
push you out into this "land of adventure." You find all sorts of things
that might be valuable, but the challenge is to decide which of those to
connect together.

CHAPTER_SWAMP_START

## Chapter SWAMP - The Swamp
==============================

Any project that has the potential to be of value, has an element of the unknown about it. It's like trying to build on a swamp. There is untapped potential. There are pitfalls. The way to succeed in this kind of environment is to acknowledge that you're exploring. One aspect of doing this exploration is user research. Another is stakeholder research. It's almost always a struggle to do either of these. For different reasons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine that a property developer has given you money to develop houses
in a swamp. How would you go about doing that? Would you just start
work? Or would you feel the need to do a little bit of exploration
first? Wouldn't it be a good idea to know what's in the swamp?

What if I told you that there were people who already live in the swamp?
And that there's no way that you're going to be able to build without
upsetting them? They don't want you to build there, they're quite
happy with things just the way they are.

But then again, there are also people who are keen to move into the
swamp when you *have* built there. They've already given the property
developer money. They want you to build in the swamp fast, so they can
move in.

People who live there, and people who want to live there. They have
interests in the swamp. But they aren't the only ones. There are people
who care generally about bogs and marshes. There are people who are
interested in building regulations for any kind of engineering or
construction. There is government. Local government will probably want
to levy some kind of tax. You will probably need planning permission.
National government will have building regulations. And beyond
government, there might even be global bodies that care about this
swamp. There are people who you need to talk to about getting a road to
come right up to the swamp. Because, whatever you're doing in the swamp,
the likelihood is that you'll need to connect to existing
infrastructure.

And there are people who don't care about you, don't care about the
property developers, all they care about is the swamp. These people
might be eco activists. They might be political activists. The swamp
might be on a very old burial ground. It might be the site of a buried
temple.

And that's just the people who are interested in the swamp. What about
the plants and animals who already in the swamp? Maybe there are new
species there, interesting to science. Maybe there are plants, unknown
to western medicine, but the locals use them as a miracle cure. What
about the geology? Maybe there's oil. Maybe there's gold.

Why am I babbling about swamps? What does this have to do with software
product development? What's the point I'm trying to make?

My point is that there are a lot of people who have very varied
interests in what you're doing. Some of those are directly associated
with the project, some of those will directly benefit from the project.
But there are also a lot of other people who are only distantly
associated with your project. When you start, you might not have heard
of them, they might not have heard of you, but you're still important
to each other. If the project is going to be a success, it would be good
to keep those people happy. Maybe there is something that you can do for
those people that would make them happy and in doing so, would make you
a fortune.

On the other hand, it might be a really bad idea to annoy them. Maybe
you can't avoid it, but it would still be good to know that it's going
to happen.

Here we're picking up on the way of seeing projects that we talked about
in [Chapter STREAMS]. Projects are things that are done in a complex
environment. There are lots of people who interested in that
environment. And the interests that they have are extremely varied.

I didn't really get this completely until I worked on one project. On
this project, I worked with a woman who did research with users. She
really did research with users. As soon as the project started, she
contacted potential users of the product and arranged meetings. She was
running workshops with them, getting to know them and developing a
relationship. First, she got to understand their "pain points". Then
she got them to start to sketch, with pen and paper, graphical user
interfaces that might start to address these points.

Then the designer on the team made interfaces informed by this research.
They looked real, but at this stage they were still only models. These
were again, tested with users. If there were serious problems with them,
they were modified and then tested again.

This kept going. She hired another researcher. They both did research on
users. They did research with internal users in the organisation we were
working for and external users, who were the organisation's customers. I
worked on this project for over three years. And the research never
stopped. It didn't stop when we had working software that we could test
with users. It didn't stop when we had a version of the software that
had a copy of the user's sensitive data running on it. This gave them a
chance to see what it would be like using the live product. It certainly
didn't stop when we went live.

I'd been involved in projects that had user researchers before. But this
was the first time that I'd seen a project that was led by user research
right from the start. And the project continued to be informed by user
research all of the way through development.

I learned a lot from watching this happen. And there were a couple of
things that were surprising about it for me. The first is that, if you
do this much research on your users you won't just find out about your
users. You'll get to know a lot about other people who aren't exactly
users. But, to lurch back to our metaphor, these are still people who
are interested in the swamp. We found other regulatory groups that our
users needed to please, and our product had to support. These were
people who, even if they weren't users, were stakeholders. And they went
on our stakeholder map.

This was another important idea that I hadn't come across before.

Do enough research on your users and you end up with a "stakeholder
map". Do even more research on your users and you get a "stakeholder
ecology". You start to understand not only who all the people are who
have some interest in the swamp, but also how these stakeholders
interact. You start to see what's really happening, in and around the
swamp. You start to see opportunities to do good and to be a success.
Many of these would not be at all obvious if you hadn't done these
investigations. And you also start to see where there are dangers and
problems and potentially unhappy people who could cause you and the
project trouble.

This project was the first time that I really understood the value of
user research. But I really should have understood it about fifteen
years earlier. Because I had previously worked on a user centred design
project. Maybe the thing was that it wasn't exactly a software
development setting. Maybe I'm just a bit slow. But I hadn't quite
connected the dots.

"What can a ten-year-old teach me?" I was sitting in an office in
Athens, arguing with a Polish software developer in a room full of
technical guys from all over Europe. None of them seemed to think that
we needed to do any user research on a project that had the phrase "user
centred design" in its title.

It was a European Union funded project. The first aim of the project was
to design an application that used tangible user interfaces. Tangible
user interfaces are interfaces that you can get hold of, pick up and
move around. The second aim of the project was to use these interfaces
to help school children construct discursive arguments. My organisation
was doing the user research for the project. "Iterative, user-centred
design" was in the title of the funding bid. Still, most of the software
developers and search engine experts on the team were sceptical. They
didn't see the point of talking to users, especially since, in this
case, our users were schoolchildren. But still, we did it.

And what we found was interesting and, as is almost always the case when
you do user research, unexpected. It pointed out a potential route
towards making a successful product. And this was a route that, if we
hadn't talked to users, we would never have imagined.

One thing that we found straight away from talking to users
(schoolchildren who were 10-11 years old) was that they didn't really
need help with the logic of an argument. For example, when discussing
the subject of graffiti, they understood that there was a contradiction
between statements like:

>> People should be able to express themselves freely

and

>> It's against the law to paint messages on public buildings.

What the kids did seem to need help with, was putting the bits of
evidence that they found into a structure that worked as a persuasive
argument.

That's the thing that we found out really quickly. And this was an
important way that we could help the residents of this particular swamp.
We found it out by doing direct research with them in schools. They
didn't need any help understanding logic. What they needed help and
support with was gathering evidence and putting it in a structure that
sounded like a persuasive argument.

That was the great thing about doing research in real schools. But when
we started to do research, we found out about some other concerned
parties who didn't live in the swamp. They were a long way away. Even
so, they really cared about what happened there - the government. At the
time when we did this research, the government insisted that all the
schools in England follow a "National Curriculum." Pretty much every
lesson that the kids did, had to show that it satisfied a specific
learning requirement.

We realised this after these early research sessions. We needed to
design our future research sessions so that, at the same time, they
directly addressed something mentioned in the curriculum. And we needed
to make it obvious to the teachers that that was what we were doing.
Why? Because the teachers were also swamp residents of course! If we did
this, we made it much easier for the teachers to support us.

Fortunately, we had an ex-teacher on our team. So, we could design our
research sessions so that they also made sense as national
curriculum-focused lessons.

A long time later, I found myself working on software development
project. This company was successful and highly regarded in one area of
business - mobile phone service provision. In the world of mobile phone
service provision it had a pretty cool image. So some of the senior
people there wondered if they could succeed in another area - personal
loans. Yes, that was the project. Making personal loans cool. Again,
this team had done a lot of work to develop a personal loan website and
they'd done lots of research with users. Then a potential business
partner mentioned a possible problem. They pointed out that any company
that lends money needs to be regulated by the financial authorities.

You may lift your eyebrows slightly at a company that didn't talk to
the regulators before starting up in the money-lending business. You can
also see that research with users and mapping of stakeholders would have
made something as important as that very clear, very quickly. User
research is great, and this project would have seriously benefitted from
user research. But the point I'm making here is that it isn't enough to
do research with users. You also have to find all these other people,
regulators, investors, commentators on the ethics of your industry. To
come back to the swamp metaphor, these are people who don't live in the
swamp. These are people who live miles from the "swamp" and who will
never visit it. But they still care what goes on in there. And if these
people aren't happy, sometimes, they can kill a project.

You might say that I'm just exaggerating. Software development projects
aren't that different from one another. Swamps aren't all that
different from one another. You've seen one swamp you've seen them
all. Do you know what this sounds like to me? Well, it sounds like
ignoring the pirate ship, for a start [Chapter SHIP].

But also, in later chapter [Chapter Ref] we're going to talk about
driving a car as a metaphor for managing a project. And here's just an
early view of that way of seeing things. Some people might say "One
project is pretty much just like any other, I don't see why you need to
do any more investigation with users." They're saying something
that's the equivalent of "Yeah, I've driven cars before, there's no
need for me to look at the road."

Yes, controlling the car, and managing the team might be similar from
project to project. But outside of the car, or the team, the environment
can be very different. And my main point in using this metaphor of the
swamp is that if you look out through the windscreen, you may well find
that there isn't a road. Or that the road is blocked by monsters. Or
that there is a very nice road, that it looks very easy to drive down,
but if you do, you will get a massive fine or, actually, in some cases
get sent to jail.

Lots of people will say that user research is a waste of time. Actually,
more often than not, they won't say that. They will agree with you. Yes,
yes, user research is very important, but it just isn't needed on this
project. Or they won't bother making any argument, they just won't put
any budget for it in their projects. They won't hire people to do it.
Lots of people will see a software development project as merely that -
a matter of software development.

Do you know what you should do if you're managing a team in this kind
of situation? You should do user research anyway. If you don't have
somebody on the team who's a dedicated user researcher, you should
still do some user research. You should do "user research" with the
people in the team that you have -- on the basis that they're sentient
humans and their responses to user interfaces will still be interesting
and useful. And you should still push to talk to users, or, where
possible include a user as a product owner or business analyst. OK, it
won't be anywhere near as good as a full programme of user research
done by professionals. But one of the main aims of doing this research
should be to find out surprising stuff. Then maybe, you can take what
you find back to whoever is paying for the project. Maybe you can show
them what you found and use it as a case for more user and stakeholder
research.

Another criticism of my insistence on user research is what might be
called the "faster horse" objection. Henry Ford said something like
"If I'd given the people what they want, I'd have given them a faster
horse." When I talk about the swamp, I'm not saying that you should
give any of those people associated with it exactly what they ask for.
What I *am* saying is that whatever you do has a much greater chance
of success if it's informed by what they've asked for.

I've worked on lots of projects where we either haven't done any user
research or haven't done anywhere near enough. And, if I'm being
totally honest, on most of those projects, it didn't bother me that
much.

I described a project earlier. The one where we did research with
children in the classroom. That project was described as "iterative
user-centred design" and that is pretty much what we did. I should have
learned from that project how important user research is. But I still
didn't really put it together. I still didn't quite realise how
important for the success of a project it is that you do iterative
design and development, and that it should be user centred. The only way
to do that is to keep talking to users and keep putting working software
in their hands.

Now that I've seen it really work, I'm convinced that it's one of the
best ways of reducing the risk on a project. But it's still going to be
very hard to persuade the people who are paying for that project that
they need user researchers. And not just one, and not just at the
beginning. They need people talking to users and potential users all the
way through. It's even harder than getting support for development of
working software.

There's something I feel I should own up to here. I'm convinced of the
value of continuing user research through a software product development
project. But I don't know how to combine user research and the early
development of working software without creating disagreements and
arguments.

Research on users and stakeholders needs to keep going all the way
through a project. And what the researchers find out needs to inform
software development. Then that software needs to be put in the hands of
users. This is what we'll talk about more in [CHAPTER ESCAPE]. Then
the team needs to listen to the feedback that comes back from users.
This feedback needs to be considered and incorporated into future
versions of the software.

Making sure that the team is well-informed is important. The best chance
of success for a project is when the team are aware of what the users
and stakeholders want. The chances get even better if the team can put
working software into users' hands. And even better still if feedback
from users starts to guide future iterations. But it isn't an easy ride.

When the interests of all, or some of the interested parties in the
swamp are discovered, it's very unlikely that they'll all be compatible.
And if they aren't, there are often going to be a lot of different
possible solutions that fully or partially satisfy one or other of the
groups' needs.

In agile methods, the final decision about what goes in the product is
supposed to rest with the product owner. The idea is that they listen to
the feedback that comes in from all directions and make good decisions
about which bits to listen to and which bits to ignore. But of course,
the product owner is just another human being. It's very likely that the
decisions that they make won't be perfect.

In a way, it's your job as a project manager to make sure that these
conflicts happen. But at the same time, you have another important job
as a project manager. You need to look after the psychological safety of
the team. Reassure your team that conflicts that are emerging as a
result of doing research are good, healthy conflicts. You may not get
things right initially. But if you're setting up an iterative process,
you don't have to. At every stage, even if you get something very
wrong, further user research will pick it up and allow you to correct
it.

What if your project has no budget at all for user research? There are
still things that you can do.

Talk to your stakeholders about risks.

This is something you should do even if your project has a full
complement of user researchers. I'd worked on many projects that had a
"risk register." My experience was that this was a document that got
written at the very beginning of a project and then ignored. As a
result, my opinion of risk registers was that they weren't very useful.
Then, at the very beginning of another project, the product owner
informed me that the organisation mandated that we have a risk register.
I told him that I didn't think that they were a good idea. But he came
back with a suggestion he had found on the internet for an "Agile" risk
register. This was a Kanban -- style board with three columns. At the
beginning of the project, we got together. Who was we? It was me -- the
delivery manager, the product owner, the product owner's boss and a few
additional senior stakeholders. In a one-off workshop, we came up with a
list of risks. We added them to the "Kanban" board and then scored them.

The idea of the score was that it was a combination of the "cost" to the
project of fixing the fallout of the risk if it actually became an
eventuality. We expressed that it, days of work for the team. For
example. A full security breach might take the whole team a month to
fix. So, we would give that risk a cost of 20. Then, we also gave each
risk a probability as a percentage. As a group, we thought that there
was a small, but not insignificant chance of this happening, so we gave
it a probability score of 5. Then the overall score of the risk was 100
(20 x 5).

Once we'd done this for all the risks that we'd identified, we ended up
with a three-column board. One column had "High risks" (>1000 points).
Another had "medium risks" (>500, <1000) and another had "small
risks". And we also had a total -- the sum of scores on all the tickets.

Every two weeks, this same group of people took another look at the risk
board. We talked through the risks, from highest to lowest and changed
the scores. And we added any new risks that anyone in the group
identified.

In one sense, none of this discussion about scores on the risks
mattered. But in another sense, it was a life saver for the project.
Because what became obvious was that, when we talked about the risks and
changes to the risks' scores, pertinent news about what was going on in
the broader organisation got discussed.

Do show and tells.

Scrum is the most popular Agile framework. And "Show and tell" is the
Scrum name for a meeting where the team demonstrate working software to
stakeholders. If you're doing user research, it's also an opportunity to
talk about the findings that you got from doing user research.
Demonstrate to yourselves and to anyone who will watch and listen. Talk
through the findings of your user research. Walk through the designs
that have been created as a result of that user research. Demonstrate
the working software that your team has been working on that week. The
development team are often reluctant to do this, especially if what
they're working on doesn't have an obvious UI. It's still important
that you insist that they do it.

Invite people from all over your stakeholder map to your show and tells.
Remember the story about the bank and the fraud project? Just one
comment might let you know something that's vital for your project.
Yes, it could derail your project, but when would you rather know?
Sooner or later?

Embrace your deadlines.

Yeah, I said it. Embrace deadlines as opportunities to negotiate scope
and set software free. Some bosses see deadlines as opportunities to
mess with you. They want to make you and your team work longer hours
while giving them time off from thinking about what a product really
needs to do. Some bosses just see the promise of delivering for a
deadline as a way of getting *their* boss of *their* back. But you
don't have to see them like that. You can see them as powerful, if a
little clumsy, ways of exploring the stakeholder map. The map of the
swamp. If you do try to release something, who jumps out and tells you
that you can't? Who suddenly appears and tries to take credit? Who
objects to you doing *anything* on the grounds of security,
accessibility, secrecy? Which non-functional requirement really is a
deal breaker that stops the software from going live? Software wants to
be free. You should want it to be free. You should do your best to help
it. We'll talk more about this in the next chapter [Chapter ESCAPE]

Exploit the crisis.

What if your team does release software that nobody wants to use? What
if your team does release software that nobody is allowed to use because
it doesn't meet regulations? One way to think of this is that all
successful software becomes iterative and incremental, sooner or later.
All successful software incorporates feedback from its users sooner or
later.

This is the point of comparing a software development project to a
development in a swamp. A software development project is, to some
degree, building on unchartered ground. Even though the people who fund
it will rarely talk about it in such terms. It's not clear what's hidden
in the waters of the swamp. It might be untold riches. It might be a
virulent disease. But whatever is found there, lots of people are going
have an opinion about it. The people who already live there, the people
who want to live there they have opinions. They have things that they
value. The same with the people who will never live there but still have
opinions and interests. This is because they are in power, or because
they want to preserve some aspect of the environment or possibly for
some other reasons. Some other reasons that, without research, it would
be difficult to really understand.

The message of this chapter is that the place that's pointed to by the
dream of a project that we talked about in [Chapter Streams] is a
mysterious and complex place. And the way to give your project the best
chance of thriving in this mysterious place is research and
investigation. Talk to as many of the interested and potentially
interested parties as you can. Understand how their interests and values
interact -- or conflict. Find out as much as you can about the lie of
the land. And one way to do this most effectively is to bring into the
team professional surveyors, user researchers who can can talk to the
interested parties. But having conversations with interested parties
isn't just the responsibility of user researchers. It's also your
responsibility as project manager. One way of thinking about project
management is as a facilitation of conversations. One way of thinking
about the chances of success in a project is by increasing the quality
of the conversations that you have with the people who have interests
and stakes in the project. The people who own, live and care about the
swamp. We'll talk about improving the quality of conversations again in
[Chapter CONVERSATION]

But there's another, complimentary way of exploring the swamp. And
that's to build something in the swamp. To let interested parties, see
touch, even feel what it's like to use this new thing. And that's what
we're going to talk about in [Chapter SOFTWARE].

CHAPTER_SWAMP_END

CHAPTER_ESCAPE_START

## Chapter ESCAPE - Working Software
======================================

In that last chapter we talked about exploring the swamp using user research. In this chapter we talk about another important method of exploration - working software. The more working software you put in the hands of users, the more likely it is that your project will succeed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>"sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"

>> Arthur C. Clarke

At the turn of the millennium a bunch of men (they were all men) got
together in a Ski Lodge in Utah and wrote the Agile manifesto. They were
all people who, for a good long while had been wrestling with the
question of how to make project management methods for software
development simpler, more lightweight and more successful. The emphasis
on simple and lightweight is possibly why the manifesto isn't a huge,
long document. It's less than a hundred words. And in the Agile
manifesto, working software is talked about as the second key value.

>> "Working software over comprehensive documentation."

Right after:

>> "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"

The primary message of the Agile manifesto is "people first", good
software comes out of discussions between people. And that's what we
talked about in the last chapter. But right after that, the founding
fathers of Agile recommend working software. It's worth asking. Why?
What was the experience of those guys who got together to talk about
"lightweight" software methodologies that made them mention "working
software" as one of the four key values.

My guess is that they had all had experience of being involved in
projects where the production of working software was delayed or had
never happened. They had worked on projects where months or years could
go by before the specification was agreed and software development could
start.

For the first forty or fifty years that software development existed,
that's how people thought it should be done. Software development was
called software engineering and it was thought to be an offshoot of
other kinds of engineering. And in other kinds of engineering, at least
in theory, nothing is built before the production of detailed plans.

This is what makes the second principle in the Agile manifesto so
revolutionary. As if in the first principle saying you should talk to
people and understand what they want isn't revolutionary enough. The
second principles is saying the engineering equivalent of "have a go at
building a bridge and see how you get on."

So why? These guys got together for the express purpose of making the
way that software development was done and was managed better. Why would
they want something about working software in the manifesto?

OK, let's make this about you for a minute. Think of something that you
know a lot about. There will be something. It doesn't have to be
anything to do with work. But think of something that you know how to
do. OK, now think of some aspect of that thing that someone who wasn't
an expert would think was strange. Why do you do that thing?

There are at least a couple of possible answers. Maybe you were taught
to do this thing by whoever taught you. Maybe it's just your own way of
doing things. But there's one answer which is very likely and very
compelling. You do things in this way because you've seen what happens
if you don't. You've learned the hard way.

And I think that that's the reason why "working software over detailed
documentation" is in the Agile manifesto. And this is a very similar
reason to one that we've discussed when we were talking about avoiding
agreed activity. Why was I pushing to avoid agreed activity and work
with the team to tackle whatever the problem was that was looming on the
horizon? Well, there are lots of good reasons, but one of the main ones
was that I've seen what happens when you don't [Chapter TRENCH].

I think it's absolutely the same reason that working software is one of
the four main things that are discussed in the Agile Manifesto. The
people who put it there have seen what happens if you don't push for
working software. But when it comes to working software, it might also
be that they've seen the good things that can come from producing
working software.

So, what is it about working software that make it so important?

You can sum up what's so important about software with these three
ideas. Magic, discovered value (leading to pull), discovered trouble.

Picking up on the quote at the beginning of this chapter, working
software is "sufficiently advanced technology" and people respond to it
as if it is magic. People respond to working software immediately,
automatically and emotionally. When they press a button, or click on a
picture, they have an expectation of what will happen. Working software
creates needs, expectations and it evokes emotions: delight, joy,
frustration and anger. This is a very different response than a
checklist of functionality in a requirements document. That means that
the only way to find out how they are going to respond, is to put actual
working software in their hands.

And when you do put software in their hands, users will find ways of
using it that you didn't expect, users will value aspects of the
software that you didn't expect. Remember the swamp? When you build in
the swamp, you will start to discover value, people will use what you've
built in unexpected ways. And when people like something, they want more
of it.. And this leads to something called "pull".

Up to the point where actual users of your software find something in
your software that they like and ask you to expand that function, or do
more of it, by delivering it in different ways, the sole driver for the
functionality in your software was the stakeholders who had originated
the project.

Now you have users, and they have things that they want. This doesn't
mean necessarily that you should give them everything that they want,
but it does mean that the dynamic of the project has changed.

And this is a huge change. It means that your project has moved from
being just someone's idea to something that people actually want,
something that has value. This might not be the only possible criteria
for success, but it's certainly one of the most important.

And this is one of the most important reasons for making working
software available as soon as possible. When we make working software
available early, we're giving it the opportunity of connecting with its
audience, of letting it create pull, of being guided by the people who
are using it in how to make it deliver more and more value.

But there other very good reasons for making your software available as
soon as possible. And one of them is perhaps best explained using a
joke.

>> You will never be alone if you take with you everywhere the
ingredients and equipment to make a dry martini. Even if you think you
are completely desolate and stranded on a desert island. Because minute
that you start to make the dry martini, someone will jump out from
behind a tree and say, "that's not how you make a dry martini."

Something like this is true of developing working software. Ideally, you
want your software to be in the environments we it will finally be used.
That means running on the computers that it's going to be running on
when it's live. You want it to be accessible to real users. You want
them to be able to use their real data, on the real software. But the
truth is that the nearer you get to doing that, the more likely it is
that people that you didn't even know existed will jump out from behind
trees. These people will tell you that "you're doing it wrong" and try
to stop you getting working software in the hands of users.

In my head, I always imagine the job of getting working software out in
the world, on a working environment, like trying to escape from a prison
camp! There's only one way to find out what all the traps are that are
out there in no man's land, and that's to try to set them off.

OK, I'm mixing metaphors. Let's stick with the man behind a tree for a
moment. Most of those things that the man who jumps out from behind a
tree will bring up are "non-functional requirements." These are
requirements that the software needs to meet but which aren't strictly
about the thing that it does. The software needs to be accessible to
users with visual impairments. The software needs to be secure. The
software is covered by some regulator in the industry that you have
never heard of.

One way to tackle all the rules and regulations that your software might
contravene is to try to take care of them in the specification. Before
any software gets written you might try to think of everything that
might possibly be required. But in my experience, it's very hard to
find out exactly what you can and can't do without trying to do
something. We can guess that the framers of the Agile manifesto had had
similar experiences.

When you're trying to list these requirements without a piece of
working software, you're only dealing with "known knowns". When you
try to get some working software as far as you can through the barbed
wire to the outside world, you soon start to find about "known
unknowns". You knew there would be other security measures out there in
no man's land, but you didn't know what they were.

This is the slightly counter-intuitive thing I'm trying to tell you.
You should try to get working software as near as you can to live. Why?
Because if you do a man will jump out from behind a tree and tell you
why you can't. The only real way to find out what there is in no-man's
land that's stopping you and your software from escaping is to push
your software through it. Let's move on to the second reason why trying
to create working software is a good idea.

The second reason is this, we might call it the "there's only one way
to find out," reason. How do you find out if you can do something? By
trying to do it.

There are lots of rules and regulations relating to - well - everything,
it seems. And software is no exception. Rules about security. Rules
about hosting. Rules about performance. In software, this red tape is
often called "non-functional requirements." And your software might
get stopped dead in its tracks by someone wearing a metaphorical peaked
cap because it doesn't meet these. And we've talked about these. But
I'm not talking about those right now. This is more straightforward
than that. These are the simplest questions that trying to get working
software answers.

Is your team capable of writing this software?

Does your team have access to the tools and resources that they need to
write this software?

Does the technology that you've decided to use work?

Is the organisation that you're working for capable and willing to pay
for the servers, people and set-up that you need to deploy this
software?

Well, there's only one way to find out the answers to these questions
and the answers might not be the ones that you're hoping for. I've
worked on teams where the team members don't have access to the office.
I've worked on teams that don't have access to the internet - "To
make internets, you need internets," one developer was forced to
explain. Of course, these are problems that can be solved, but only once
they're uncovered.

So, this is the most straightforward reason why a team should be trying
to develop software as soon as possible, because there is only one way
to find out.

But there's a third reason. Software is magical and the way that people
respond to it is magical. People don't respond to working software in
the way that they respond to feature lists or specifications.

Think about it. Think about the pieces of software that you interact
with every day. Are you thinking about them in terms of lists of
features? When you're using some piece of software, you are using it to
do something. You have other things on your mind. A funny joke that you
want to share, a report that you want to write or a podcast that you
want to listen to.

And this, final reason is the main reason that it's useful to try to
move a project towards delivering working software earlier rather than
later. By putting working software in the hands of the people who will
use it, you start to solve the Flowers and fruit that well talk about in
[Chapter Ref]

When you put working software in the hands of users, you move the
discussion. You move the discussion and the dynamic of the project away
from flowers. And it isn't just the discussion, it's the actions. The
focus isn't any more about the shiny list of things that a piece of
software might do. Now the discussion is about fruit. What does the
software actually do? Now that it's in people's hands, does it do
something that's useful for them. What can we do to make this thing
that users are already using even better?

I worked on a project for an organisation that was still doing pretty
much all of its business using paper documents. This was a huge
organisation, and it processed a lot of paper. The project that I was
working on looked at just one of these paper processes. The aim was to
take it over and make it manageable using an electronic document
handling and storage system.

And the project had a couple of good things going for it. Firstly, it
was using an Agile way of doing things. Secondly, the product owner was
a former clerk of the company. She knew all the other clerks and she
knew their business very well.

Even so, to start with the project had a tough time. We couldn't get
servers to put the software on. The open-source document package we'd
chosen wasn't as mature as we thought. But we pushed on through some
early design iterations. We dealt with a load of technical problems.
Finally, we got to one show and tell where the team had working software
that they could show.

It was an odd turning point in the project. Because that first demo was
so terrible. We'd managed to pare down the demo to a view of a
collection of documents and then a display of the document when its
title was clicked. In that first demo, when we clicked on the document
link, a window came up that said "Do you want to veiw [sic] your
document?" Yes, with that spelling mistake. And then when the user
clicked "OK" an error message appeared.

The look on the product owner's face! At this point we were about half
a million pounds into a two million pounds project. And all she had to
show was a misspelled dialog box that led to an error message. It was a
hard time for her. It was extremely embarrassing for the team.

But two weeks later it was a slightly different story. Now there was a
list of documents. Now when the document was clicked, the chance to open
the document had a button that was spelled correctly. And when it was
clicked, the document was displayed!

The product owner seemed a little bit more relaxed.

Not too many "show and tells" after that, the product owner had a
question. "Can I get this on a laptop so I can show it to the clerks?"

The short answer to that question was "no" because all of this nearly
half a million pounds worth of software was deployed only on developer
laptops. But the product owner's request to have a version that she
could take around the country and to show off was a powerful move
forward, if we could actually do it. And it provided a good extra reason
to negotiate with the people who were supposed to be giving us server
space.

Once the software was on her laptop, the product owner went on the road.
The demo still wasn't much. The demo still had bugs. We still had some
spelling problems, but the expression on her face every time we
encountered them made sure that they got fixed pretty quickly! The
demonstration by the product owner to her own former workmates went very
well. She could wave past any user interface issues, or problems. She
could show the other clerks first sight of something that could make
their lives a lot easier.

She came back with a list of problems she'd come across while using the
demo. She also had a list of suggestions for features that had come from
the clerks. But she also came back with one important questions - "When
will it be ready?"

From that point on, the nature of the project changed. It wasn't about
delivering on a list of functions. It was about rolling out to the
clerks all across the country the tiny bit of working software that the
product owner had shown them. Suddenly the road of what we needed to do
rolled out before us, with the people we delivering to cheering us on.

There was another very interesting thing about getting some working
software in front of the people who might use it. By doing this we both
asked and then started to answer the two questions that I've already
talked about. "Can we do this?" and "Who is going to jump out and
stop us if we do?"

To the first question, the answer at first was "No." We didn't have
any server space where we could deploy a live service. This was blocked
because of a dispute. The price of providing and supporting the servers
was not included in the contract. The client argued that they shouldn't
have to commission the servers. Neither should they pay for them or
support them. This became a much harder argument for the clients to make
once people in their own company were asking for the software.

Suddenly the people who were trying to negotiate free stuff from their
suppliers were in the way of their own colleagues. Now they weren't
helping the company by being tough on costs. Rather they were stopping
people who worked for their organisation from getting something they
wanted. Something that could make their lives easier. Suddenly the
servers appeared, and then money for people to support the servers
appeared. A real roll-out of the software started to happen.

To the second question, "If we try to do this, is anybody going to jump
out from behind a tree and stop me?" The answer was "yes." In fact,
two people jumped out. An accessibility guy and a security guy. The
accessibility guy claimed that there was no way the software could be
released until it met an extra set of requirements. Again, the client (I
think he'd been on a negotiation course) claimed that we should have
known about these requirements right from the start and so we should pay
for them.

And by the way, the client was right. We should have built in
accessibility right from the start. It takes no more effort in coding to
make sure that a website is accessible. And it actually makes the site
much easier for all kinds of people to use. And those people who you
might not think of as disabled. Do it. It makes sense. If in doubt, pay
a blind guy to look at your site. Does this sound insensitive? I really
don't think it is, but maybe that's because I happen to have several
friends who are blind guys who dearly wish that any company that writes
software would ask a blind guy to look at their site.

OK. Accessibility. We were wrong. And I, at least, have learned from the
mistake. Then, from behind another tree jumped the security guy. He said
that the project should never be allowed to go live until we could prove
that it was secure. Just to leave us in no doubt about his effectiveness
as a blocker, he also refused to tell us what it was we needed to change
so that it would be secure. And of course, the costs of any changes we
made needed to be borne by us rather than the client.

As people who jump out from behind trees trying to block progress go,
these two looked pretty effective. Both were telling us we couldn't
release until we did what they said, both were telling us that we had to
pay to do what they said. The security guy was being even more effective
at blocking us because he was also not telling us what it was that we
had to do.

But neither of these guys was a match for the clerks. There were a lot
of clerks. They'd seen that this software would make their lives much
easier. We kept gradually improving the accessibility, but we went live
with what we had. We submitted the software to outside security testing.
We addressed the most serious issues that arose, and then we went live
with some others still being looked at.

Putting bad software that just about worked in front of real users
completely changed the project. Why? Because it started to put together
the "virtuous" value stream that we talked about in chapter "STREAMS."
Putting real working software in front of real users created pull. And
that completely changed the dynamic (and control) of the project.

Please pay attention to this because it's important. This is how you
make a project that seems impossible, possible. You build something that
starts to deliver value for your customers.

How do you do this on your project? Every project is a little bit
different. But I'm going to arbitrarily invent a rule of sixths. This
feels about right. If you think your project is about 6 months long,
I'll give you a month to do some set up. If, not long after a month, you
and your team don't have *something* that works, you've waited too
long. By the end of a sixth of the time, you need a tiny piece of
working software. A small bit of software that starts to do the thing
that it's supposed to be doing. And you need to be able to show this
software to the people who will finally use it.

And once you've got this tiny little thing, you should be looking to
"promote its status" in some way. By that, I mean get the software being
used by more users. Or set the software up so that it's using live, or
like-live data. Or make it's deployment more automatic so it can run on
more than one machine and in more than one environment.

What's important with working software, is not so much what you've
got, but that you've got *something* and it's moving in all the
right direction. Sure, it needs to be increasing in terms of what it can
do. But it also needs to be moving from developer environments, to test
environments and onto live environments. And it needs to be moving from
being tested by the team to being tested by "friendly" users to being
tested by complete strangers. If it's a business application, it needs
to move from using dummy data, to using data that looks like live data,
to using real data.

I know nothing about rock climbing. But this seems to me to be a little
bit like if you're climbing a huge rock face. You climb a bit, then you
put in one of those things that holds the rope to the rock. Then you
pull on it, to make sure it's firm and would hold you if you fell, then
you can climb a bit more.

Yes, delivering software is a bit like that. It's a bit like climbing a
rock face (and it's like escaping a prison camp, and there's a guy
jumping out from behind a tree, I know, I know, too many metaphors). The
odd thing is how many people think that you can get to the top without a
rope. Even odder are the people who somehow imaging that you can get to
the top of the cliff in one single bound.

Gradually developing working software in all of those directions (size
of user base, reproducibility of environment, reality of data) is the
careful and effective way to deliver something on your project.
Especially if that something seems impossible. And if the thing that
you're doing is in any way useful or interesting to the people who will
use it, at some point you will start to get "pull". Obviously, you'd
like this sooner rather than later. But at some point, you will start to
get the magical "pull" demand for the users rather than "push" demand
from its sponsors.

And of course, gradually developing software in these directions will
also result in people jumping out from behind trees. They will helpfully
provide you with extra rules and regulations that you need to follow.
Also sometimes, they'll tell you that you can't proceed until you're
certified. How do you get certified? Oh that, they don't know.

You will need to negotiate these obstacles before your software can
finally escape and live free in the real world. Push working software as
far as you can towards being live with real users. It's the most
powerful secret to actually delivering things that seem impossible. And
everybody, or nearly everybody, will try to stop you doing it, even
people you thought were your friends, colleagues and allies

What? Yes, that's right. Incrementally delivering working software is
the thing that you need to do. It's the thing that's most likely to
help your project succeed. Still, nearly everybody will try to stop you
doing it.

How? Why?

Let's deal with the how and the why separately.

How? Developers will tell you that there's no point breaking big bits
of functionality into smaller bits. Even though, those bits could be
shown, released and tested sooner. They'll say that it "only makes
sense" to release some bit of functionality in one big piece.

How? Stakeholders will tell you that there's no point troubling users
with small bits of functionality. They'll tell you that users only want
to see the whole, finished, journey. They'll tell you that showing them
anything sooner is a waste of time and money.

How? Some users will tell you that there's no point looking at the new
system until it has their real data in it. Some other users won't be
interested in using the software until it really works. They won't want
to use it until when they press the "launch missile" (or business
equivalent) button something actually happens.

How? Stakeholders will tell you that test servers are expensive.

How? Stakeholders will tell you that the live environment is only in the
budget from the week before the project is scheduled to finish.

How? Product managers, even good product managers, that you like and
trust, they will utter the dread, tragic words "we need it all, so I
don't think it's important what order it gets done in."

But why? Why don't people want working software?

Why? The reason people don't want working software is something we've
already talked about. It's the same reason that the improvisers that we
talked about in [Chapter ref] don't want to deal with the pirate
ship. Without having to think about it, people know that dealing with
working software, or with the pirate ship that just appeared on the
horizon, will mean that they have to *change*. They will have to
change what they think. They also might have to change what they do. We
are all automatically, and subconsciously resistant to change. Even if
we work in managing projects, which is manifestly the business of
bringing about change.

Why? The other reason is that trying to get software working attacks the
"Flower" of an idea that we talk about in [Chapter STREAMS]. This is
the aspect of the idea that people think is good, even without giving it
any thought. These are the aspects of ideas that tend to be of the form
"all", "same", "faster", "cheaper."

Trying to get even a tiny bit of software working tends to undermine
some aspects of an idea. If just getting *something* to work takes so
long, and that something is so slow and has cost *how much* money?
Suddenly the idea doesn't look so shiny and appealing.

Why? Another reason that people don't want to let software be free are
the "tree people". The people who jump out from behind trees and tell
you that things can't be done. Nobody wants to see them. Nobody wants to
deal with whatever extra requirements and regulations they place on your
project. The people who came up with the original idea don't want this.
The team who are doing the development don't want this.

Moving towards working software does a whole lot of things that in
general people want to avoid. It throws up a lot of technical problems
that require thinking. It throws up a lot of rules, regulations and
restrictions about what can and can't be done that require even more
thinking. It makes obvious how slow and expensive it is to just get
*some* of a product. And in doing so, it tends to undermine the
"simple", "fast", "all", "cheap" appeal of the original "flower"
of an idea.

These are all very good reasons for not getting software working.
Getting software working throws up all kinds of surprises. It will
always be very tempting to stop.

You will start to feel these reasons for not doing working software. You
will see other people being persuaded by them. At this point it's
really important that you understand these reasons why you should carry
on.

### You're going to have to do it sooner or later -- or never

And sooner is much better that later. Why? Because of all those problems
that you encounter when you start to deliver small amounts of software.
Encountering those problems early is a good thing. You will get problems
with the technology. You will get problems with moving the software from
one environment to another. You will start to hear of previously
unheard-of rules and regulations. You will get problems I haven't
thought of and problems you haven't thought of. There is no way around
all of those problems. The only way to deal with them is to get through
them. If you start to deliver something early, then you can deal with
these problems in bite size pieces. If you put off dealing with these
problems until later, you'll be forced to try to deal with them all at
once.

### Working software teaches you things about the problem that
you're solving.

Delivering working software gives you enormous amounts of information
about the environment in which you're working. Putting working software
in front of potential users teaches you about your users. But trying to
get software onto live and "like live" environments also teaches you
about your stakeholders. Who values this project? How is it seen in the
rest of the organisation? When you do stuff, you learn stuff.

### You create "pull" -- or you don't

Sometimes, when you put working software in the hands of users you get a
response that you weren't expecting. "What the hell is this? This
makes no sense at all." Or even worse, apathy and silence. Nobody says
anything, everyone just ignores it.

This may not be pleasant. But when do you want to find out? You might be
grateful that you found this out when you were a small percentage of the
way into the project. You, your team and your stakeholder have only
spent a small amount of your time, money and resources. There's still
time to change direction, take account of the feedback and do some
things differently.

And having users object to your software, or even hate it, isn't
actually the worst response they can give. The worst response is utter
indifference. Sometimes you show users your software and they really
don't care. They don't like it. They don't *not* like it. They are
just indifferent. This is the most difficult kind of feedback to deal
with because it doesn't give the project any guidance about where to go
next. But even such a non-response is useful earlier rather than later.
Again, it's worth asking yourself, when would you, or your sponsors
like to find out that nobody cares about your project? Now, when you've
spent less than a quarter of the time and money? Or later?

Of course, there's another response that you're hoping for if you put
small amounts of working software in the hands of users. If you're
lucky they will ask just one question - "When can I have this?" And
then, almost certainly, they will follow that up with "Could it do
this? It would be really nice if it also did this." This is what
you're looking for from working software. You're looking for pull.
You're looking for a way of prioritising the things that the software
currently does and the things that the software could do. And you want
this based on actual value to the users (fruit) rather than superficial
appeal to the internal sponsors and funders of a project (flowers). This
is the start of constructing the "virtuous" value stream that we talked
about in [Chapter Streams]

Once you've found something that users want, especially if it's
something that your software can provide, you will have made substantial
progress. You will have moved a long way down the road of moving a
project from impossible, to possible. But by doing that you've also
made the problem a lot more complicated. By trying to get software out
into the real world, you will probably have had people jump out from
behind trees. They will have told you that you're not allowed to put
software out into the real world. These people are now on the list of
people that you have to please. By putting working software in front of
users, if you're lucky, you'll have created demand and expectation.
Now it's obvious to you that you need to satisfy some of these demands
and expectations if this project is going to be a success.

What about the people who got this project funded? And what about the
people who actually funded it?

All of a sudden, they're not as in control of the project as they were,
the project has been let out into the wild world. It isn't just their
baby anymore. People may not react to this well. It may feel that
you've deliberately pushed you and your team and a project into a
storm, when they could have stayed in calmer waters. Well, yes, that is
exactly what you've done. This may feel a bit stupid, so it's
important to remember why you've done it. You've done it because
staying "safe" not being changed won't get you where you, your team
and your project need to be.

What's important as you move through these difficult waters, is to keep
pointed and keep pushing in the right direction. You need to keep
pushing the working software towards the real world, real users and real
data. If what you're doing is adding functionality to the software that
can then be tested with users, then good, you're going in the right
direction. If what you're doing is making the software fit better with
non-functional requirements, that's moving in the right direction. If
what you're doing is moving the software nearer to going live with live
data and being used by real users, then you're starting to make this
project look possible.

Do you know what? I think we might be nearly at the end of part one of
this book. Now might be time for a re-cap.

We started out by making it clear that this book is intended to help
project managers. Not all project managers. The focus is project
managers who are helping teams build projects that involve software
development.

We admitted the challenging fact that lots of projects either start out
looking impossible or, because of various twists, turns and unexpected
events, end up looking impossible. But then we tried to cheer ourselves
us with a quote from the software pioneer Alan Kay -- "Point of view is
worth 90 IQ points." I'm making no claims for the wholesomeness of IQ
points, but this is difference between being of average intelligence and
being a genius. This gave us just a tiny glimmer of hope. What if we
could look at the projects that we're trying to manage in a different
way? Or maybe *several different ways*. Maybe we can make some of
these seemingly impossible projects that we're working on seem possible?

And so on to our first point of view. The pirate ship. Or rather the
point of view of an ordinary ship that's being approached by a pirate
ship. What should the crew do when they see a pirate ship on the
horizon? Well, they should admit that there's a pirate ship. What should
the captain and his officers do? They should thank the crew and try to
all work together to figure out how to deal with the approaching
catastrophe. What shouldn't the crew do? They shouldn't scrub the decks
and pretend that the pirate ship isn't there? What shouldn't the captain
do? They should never, ever tell the crew off for pointing out pirate
ships. Even if some of these "ships" turn out to be mirages. Because if
they do, all they'll get from that moment on from the crew is head down
deck scrubbing. Right up to the point where the captain is either forced
to walk the plan or go down with their ship.

Where do ideas come from? Nobody's really sure. They're like springs
that suddenly gush out of the ground as if apparently from nowhere. Of
course, we know that there must be a source be we're not sure we'll ever
no where it is. Where do successful products come from? Successful
products come from a value stream.

## Chapter CAR - Driving a Car or The Empirical Process
=========================================================

Project management is all about facilitating the empirical process. Be transparent and encourage and facilitate transparency in others. Look at what's going on, encourage others to look at what's going on. Change what you and your team do in light of what you see.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> "Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable." - Albert
Camus

"Empirical" isn't a common word. But empirical process refers to
something that we're all doing all day every day. All day every day we
change what we're doing in response to what we see and experience
through our senses. And that's what the word "empirical" means. It
means relating to experience in the real world. It's a slightly odd
word that doesn't sound as down to earth and practical as it is.

For years I've run training courses to introduce people to Agile ideas.
Because "empirical" is a slightly strange word, there's an exercise
that I often do where I get people to look up the word and to discuss
what it means. Then we do exercises. These exercises often involve Lego.

I give the team a bunch of Lego models. I ask them to estimate how many
of the models they can build in a short, fixed space of time. These
short, fixed amounts of time are called "iterations," in Agile.

Almost always, at the end of the first iteration, the team realise that
they can't do as many models in the time as they initially thought.

So, part-way through the exercise this forces the teams to do something
different, based on this new experience. Either they reduce their
estimates of the number of models they can build or, possibly simplify
the models. At the end of the exercise, I come back to this word
"empirical." Empirical means based on experience.

That is the key point that I'm trying to get across in this exercise.
Learning from experience is important. Modifying what you do in light of
what happens is a fundamental approach to controlling and improving your
performance. And this doesn't just apply to your performance, it also
applies to the performance of projects.

What are we doing every day that's so vital? What we're doing is
honouring what are referred to as the three pillars of empirical process
- transparency, inspection and adaptation. When are we doing this? All
the time, but one time when we're especially doing it, that I'm going
to use as an example, is when we're driving a car.

Imagine that you're driving a car. The first thing that you need is
transparency. You need to be able to see out of the windscreen. If the
windscreen is covered in mud, or being washed with buckets of rain, or
frosted up with ice, that's bad. And it isn't just looking forward
that's important. You'd like to see behind you through your mirrors.
So the wing mirrors need to be there and the back windscreen needs to be
clear. When you're driving, before you even start moving, you need
transparency. And if you don't have it, things can go wrong very fast.

But transparency isn't enough. If you're driving, it isn't enough for
the windscreen to be clear, you still need to actually look out of it.
You need to look out of the windscreen and check your mirrors. If
instead, say, you're checking messages on your phone, or distracted and
trying to brush scalding hot coffee out of your lap, that's no good.
Transparency isn't enough by itself. You need inspection as well.

We're focusing here on the visual aspects of driving. But we all know
that when you're driving, you're also really checking with your other
senses. If you feel an unusual vibration accompanied by a dull thudding
sound there's a good chance that you'll slow down. If you smell
petrol, or burning, you'll probably slow down. If you hear police
sirens, you'll check in your rear view mirror and check if the police
seem to be interested in you. If they are, you'll probably speed up if
you're in the middle of committing a bank robbery. If you're doing
nothing to be ashamed of, you'll probably slow down.

So, inspection isn't just a visual thing. It's paying attention with
all the senses. Talking about slowing down and speeding up brings us to
the third pillar of empirical process - adaptation. What we're doing
when we slow down, is adapting. That's also what we're doing when we
speed up because we see the road is clear. It's also what we do when we
swerve to avoid something or put the fog lights on when it's foggy.
Adaptation is when we change what we're doing because of what we sense,
what we see, hear and feel.

Notice how, for these aspects of empirical control to work, they have to
be arranged correctly. They are dependent on each other. We can't drive
successfully without transparency - if the windscreen were covered in
mud, we would not see the things that we needed to avoid. We couldn't
do it without inspection. If we didn't look up from our texting and see
the thing we were about to hit, we wouldn't feel the need to swerve.
And finally, we wouldn't be swerving if it weren't for adaptation. All
of these things together are empirical process.

At this point, I might mention that I've crashed two cars. So nobody is
going to say that I'm an expert on driving. But I am an expert on what
these principles of empirical process mean for software development
teams.

Let's start with transparency. What does transparency mean for software
development teams? Well, I'm afraid it means meetings. There are at
least three meetings add transparency into the software development
process.

The stand-up is a short meeting that all the members of the team have
every working day. Each member of the team says what they did the
previous working day, what they're going to do today and highlights
anything that's blocking them. It's pretty obvious how this maps back
to the driving analogy and empirical process. The stand-up has all the
pillars of the empirical process. It has transparency, members of the
team are telling each other what they're doing and pointing out any
problems that they're having with it. It has inspection. Well, it has
inspection, so long as team members are listening to what other team
members are saying. And the stand-up is also a crucial opportunity for
adaptation. When they hear about the progress, or lack of progress of
other members of the team, it them becomes relatively natural for the
team to change their behaviour in response to what they hear. To adapt.
Either by focussing on the problem and fixing it, or understanding that
the problem can't be fixed right now (or ever) and routing round it.

Members of the team should let others know what they're doing, what
they're going to do in the daily stand up. And they should also point
out any problems that they are experiencing.

Another meeting that implements the three pillars of empirical process
is the retrospective. In retrospectives, the team looks in the rear-view
mirror. They look at the road behind them and talk about what progress
they have made down it. They have time to reflection the things that
blocked their path. They get to talk about how they could have dealt
with the obstructions more easily. What things they've got the hang of
now, that means that next time they might be able to tackle obstacles
faster in the future. They also get to talk about the things that they
still have no idea how to handle at all. The obstacles that are still in
the way and the things that are still slowing them down.

The final Agile meeting that implements the pillars of the empirical
process, is the show and tell. I'm not sure what the reason is, but
this is a meeting that goes by a lot of different names, all of which
mean the same thing - "Sprint demo" or "showcase."

The show and tell is a regular demonstration of working software that
shows exactly the real progress that the team are making. And of course,
that can really be a problem.

The first ever Agile software development project that I worked on was
for a publishing company. When I joined the project, it had been going
for over a year and had cost many millions of pounds. The way that I
heard the story, a few months before I joined, there had been a show and
tell meeting. It was an international company and it had offices in
London and in New York. There were people with American accents dialling
in on a conference call.

I don't know much about what happened in that meeting. I do know that
at some point one of the Scrum Masters said that he was going to share
project progress. This was progress that had been made through "the
backlog." The backlog is the Agile way of saying the list of all the
requirements for the project. But I'm not going to use that word any
more throughout the whole of this book. Simply because it's one of
those words which is used in Agile in a specific way but seems to cause
more confusion and difficulty than it does clarity and progress. So from
now on, I'm going to use the phrase "To do list." And for each of the
items in the "To do list" I'm going to use "To do list items."

He had a presentation with some slides. And there was a bit of messing
about setting up the presentation - and then making sure that it was
shared with the office in New York. Finally, everything was set up and
the scrum master could move to the slide that showed progress of the
project. He clicked on to the slide. In the middle of the slide was a
giant "2".

I don't know how dramatic he was at this point. I don't know if he
asked anybody in the room or on the phone if they could guess what the
two meant? 2 weeks to finish? 2 Months? 2 Years? But I know that at some
point he did get the point across. The 2 was percent. Progress on the
project, after six months and many millions of pounds was 2 percent of
all the work that was in the to do list.

This is brutal transparency. And it probably came out of desperation.
Having worked on that project I can guess that someone had told the
bosses in New York that the project would be finished by a certain date.
Nobody had mentioned to the bosses the problems that were being found.
Problems that were slowing progress to a crawl.

The main result of that number 2 was that that Scrum Master was never
allowed to speak at a show and tell again. The bosses in New York hired
a "traditional project manager" to communicate progress across the
Atlantic. After that, guess what? The news was always good.

This is what one friend of mine said about this meeting:

>> I remember an explosion of anger over the phone where the entire
team (50+ people) were dressed down and told to get on with it or heads
will roll.

But what does it tell us? What does it tell us about empirical process,
transparency and adaptation? And in the end, what does that tell us
about delivering the impossible.

OK. Let's start here. I'm going to put on my magic fortune teller's
hat and I'm going to look into your project. Mmmmm. Ahhh. Mmmmm.
Actually, I don't need a funny hat and a cloak, and I don't need the
strange noises. If you have a project, and this project has yet to
deliver its first live release and that release has a deadline, I
already know one thing about it.

> Your project is supposed to deliver N times more work than can
possibly be delivered by the deadline.

What's N? On a "good" project N is two or three. I've seen lots of
projects where N is 7 or 8. On the project that I just told you about
where the Scrum Master brought up the "2" on the screen, N was
somewhere between 25 and 50!

But maybe I'm wrong about your project. Maybe your project is fine.
Maybe you're reading a book called "Delivering the Impossible" out of
idle curiosity. You wonder what it would be like to work on one of those
projects that seems impossible. But your project? Your project is fine!
Maybe.

But if your project isn't fine, what are you going to do about it?
Telling it like it is, as the Scrum Master in the story tried to,
doesn't seem to work that well. In that case, it resulted in the hiring
of someone to specifically stop the bosses in New York being told the
truth.

Someone senior might well have promised something that is impossible to
deliver. Getting them to deliver anything near that might be a difficult
process, requiring careful handling. Yes, that's for the bosses.
Diplomacy, tact, careful handling and an understanding of the politics
may well be required.

But for the team that's doing the work? It's never a bad thing for the
team to know the truth as soon as possible. If you're in charge of that
team, you should keep the windscreen clean. You should take every chance
to make sure things are transparent. This means making sure that the
meetings which aid transparency are happening. It means that people feel
free to talk in the stand-up about any problems that they're coming
across. It means people feel comfortable speaking out in retrospectives
about anything else that might be bothering them. It means that show and
tells are honest about progress and show working software.

The second thing is to understand that shouting out bad news in front of
fifty people might not be the best way of communicating it.

Here is where you might be a lot better at this than me. Like the guy in
the "2" story, I'm not very diplomatic. Like the guy in the "2"
story, I've nearly gotten fired for telling it like it is in front of
the wrong audience. You might be more diplomatic. You might have a
better way of dressing up bad news.

But here are some other things that it's important to understand.

Everybody in the room knew that "Mr Two" was right. The bosses in New
York heard what he said. Unfortunately, the way that "Mr Two" said it
was so confrontational that their reaction was exactly the wrong one.
Their response was to hire someone to stop him telling them the truth
ever again.

We started to talk about the rather jolly metaphor of driving a car as a
way of thinking about empirical process. And by doing that, we've ended
up right at the absolute nitty-gritty of project management.

To manage a project, you need transparency. When you achieve that
transparency, you get bad news, almost always. Then, as a team, you have
to do something with the bad news. What do you do with the bad news?

So what was bad about what Mr Two did? What was bad about what he did
was that he upset the bosses. He made them feel stupid in front of the
whole team. And the result of that was that they made very sure that
they didn't hear any news from him again. They appointed a "project
manager" who never ever told them any bad news. Please note that this
didn't mean that there was never any bad news.

Of course, another thing that was bad about the situation was that it
had been allowed to reach such a point. My guess is that this wasn't
the first time that "Mr Two" had tried to point out actual progress.
He'd probably tried several times to make clear what measures of actual
progress meant for when the project would finish. Mr Two's action was a
reaction against a powerful, top-to-bottom (and probably top-down)
system of agreed activity. In the end he was forced to shout out
"There's a Pirate Ship! Oh my God! There's a pirate ship! Can't you
see it?".

What was good about what Mr Two did was that he did manage to get a
message to the bosses. And even if the result was that they made sure
that they never heard from him again, there's no doubt that they heard
it. And it's interesting to note, they didn't fire him.

Is there anything else he could have done? that would have made the
situation better. It seems that everybody in the organisation didn't
want to hear what he was saying. So what could he have done?

Well, there are are few things. All of them are partial. But they're
all powerful.

He could, and should have continued to keep track of the project's
progress. Even when the bosses had ignored him. Why? Because this is
still useful information. Actual progress tells you not only when a
project is likely to "Finish" but also how long any particular piece
of work should take.

He could have pushed more to get working software to where it finally
needs to go. He could have done more to get it into the hands of real
users. Because real users were the people that the bosses had to listen
to.

And he shouldn't have taken it personally. It's easy to say that. From
my experience, it's difficult to do it.

Transparency, inspection and adaptation is the best chance that you have
of delivering a project. What every trouble your project is in, it's
normally a good idea to increase these things. Are you stand-ups getting
repetitive? Is nobody really saying anything in them? Have battle lines
been drawn over some disagreement, so nobody is saying anything about
it? What can be done differently to get around the problem?

## Chapter CHAOS -- Cynefin and the Edge of Chaos
===================================================

Software development is "complex" -- that means that even when we have lots of experience and do things in the right way, problems might still occur. A lot of business is "chaotic" -- experience can count for nothing and it might be that there just isn't a right way to do things. Software development sits on the border between the complex and the chaotic. Almost the only absolutely certain thing is that if you treat it as if it's a simple problem, you're guaranteed to fail.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Concept

There is a model of project management that has chaos on the diagram.
This is the Cynefin framework. This is a framework that was developed
and is still being advocated by a working consultant, Dave Snowdon. And
it keeps changing, Snowdon keeps refining the details, but when I first
came to know about it, the Cynefin framework had four sectors. Four
sectors which represent different kinds of problem-solving environments.
This is how I explain those four sectors.

#### Simple

Simple. This is the first sector. Some problems are simple. They are
understood. Pretty much anybody can solve these problems.

The type of problem that I like to use as an example in this sector is
cake. Ingredients for cake are well understood. The equipment needed to
make cake is well understood. And there are recipes. Also, people
understand the value of cake. Cake is nice. People like it, is has
straightforward value.

So most people can make the simplest kinds of cake. These are problems
that almost anyone can solve.

Another thing to notice about cake -- the value of cake is obvious. Most
people like cake! OK, there might be some people who don't like cake
because eating it makes them put on weight. OK, there might be some
people who for various dietary reasons can't eat it. But for most
people, the value of cake is very clear. Crucially connected to this,
the relationship between the effort involved and the value produced is
relatively well understood. People know the value of cake and the
roughly know the amount of effort involved to make it.

#### Complicated

Next to the "Simple" sector on the Cynefin diagram is the complicated
sector. There are lots of different kinds of problems in the complicated
sector. But they have one thing in common. Like the problems in the
simple sector, they are understood (by some people at least) and there
are agreed, effective, solutions that can be applied. But there is also
a crucial difference between complicated problems and simple problems.
Complicated problems can be understood and solved, like simple problems.
But complicated problems can't be *easily* understood or *easily*
solved. Complicate problems can only be solved by someone -- as the
phrase goes that's used in patent applications "Skilled in the art."

Anyone who wants to solve a complicate problem will need to go on a
training course, they might need to go on several training courses,
those courses may take years. But if you pay attention and do well on
the courses, at the end of them, you will be able to understand and
solve these complicated problems.

This level of training an education is the big difference between simple
and complicated problems. But, as well as solutions being known and
available, there is another similarity between simple and complicated
problems. Their value of solving them is understood. And as with simple
problems, the relationship between value and effort is understood. We
have respect for doctors especially surgeons because we know that they
studied for a long time and that the outcome of that study is to be able
to do lifesaving operations.

#### Complex

OK, here's where it gets interesting. Next to the complicated sector,
we have the complex sector. In the complex sector most of the certainty
that we had in the complicated and the simple sectors disappears.
Problems aren't perfectly understood, and solutions don't perfectly
work. Obviously these two uncertainties are connected. In the complex
sector, it isn't that nobody has any idea how to solve the problems.
There are still suggested approaches that work a substantial proportion
of the time. There is a *degree* of success. But there are some
situations for which there aren't any clear solutions.

And, I think you were probably expecting this, unfortunately for us,
this is where software development sits. Why? Here are a few reasons.

1.  The "tech stack". Any project that involved software development
    doesn't just involve one piece of software. It involves lots of
    different pieces of software, which, ultimately, then run on
    hardware. All of these layers of hardware and software depend on
    each other. So that a change at the hardware level can mean that
    software doesn't run any more. A change at the operating system
    level can mean that networking doesn't work exactly as expected. And
    change to the language that the project is being written in can
    affect how the software behaves and performs. The instinct then,
    might be to stop any of these things changing. But that too, is
    fraught with its own problems.

2.  There's no perfect way of expressing what we want the software to
    do. This is what, in philosophy we might call a "strong claim", but
    it's the kind of thing that's easily shown by asking someone to
    write down all the steps involved in making a cup of tea. Pretty
    soon you realise that you're making a *lot* of assumptions, or you
    have a lot of dependencies, if you want to see them that way.
    Assumptions about the quality of the water, about the availability
    of electricity, about what the right amount of milk is. A
    requirements document for making a cup of tea would be a non-trivial
    thing. And remember, when you try to write down what you want to
    happen when making a cup tea, you're trying to describe the solution
    of a *simple* problem. If you're trying to describe any reasonably
    complicate interaction between humans and software, which probably
    also involves business rules.

3.  Empirical evidence. Software development projects go wrong. They go
    wrong a lot. If there were a way of making sure that software
    projects were successful, even if it took as long, or longer than
    training to be a surgeon or an architect, someone would have put
    together that training and the success rate for software development
    projects would be higher than it is. Even using agile methods,
    research indicates that at least twenty percent of software
    development projects fail completely. Another thirty percent are
    "challenged," meaning that they are either materially late or cost
    materially more than was expected.

The complicated problem-solving space isn't just where software
development sits. It's where all kinds of consultancy sits. especially
"management consultancy" sits. But it's also where all sorts of fakery
and quackery sits. This is why people can be so rude about consultants.
And this is why this book is neither going to be the first nor the last
about the difficulties of managing software development.

So, once we move away from simple and complicated, to the complex sector
of the Cynefin framework. Most of the certainty that we had when solving
simple and complicated problems is gone. And with it disappears any
obvious relations between the effort put into solving a problem and the
value that's returned. [The value of solving complex problems gets
sucked into this vortex The cost isn't obvious, and the relationship
between cost and value isn't obvious]

#### Chaotic

Then there's a fourth sector. Chaos. In the chaotic sector, the
problems aren't understood at all and the solutions to the problems
aren't understood at all. Unlike in the complex sector, there are no
recognised solutions that work in this sector. In the chaotic sector,
you just have to try things, celebrate when things work, or shrug it off
when things don't work.

~~T~~his is my experience:

>> Software development works best in the complex sector. Software
development is always tending towards the chaos sector.

And actually, sometimes:

>> Software development is always tending towards another sector, that
I haven't told you about, called "Disorder". Disorder is when you
don't know which sector you're in, and so you have no idea how to behave
or what to expect.

What? Why? How?

Reason #1 - the business is chaotic.

Software development itself isn't a chaotic activity. But software is
often trying to track or profit from activities which are chaotic. A lot
of entrepreneurial business is chaotic. In fact, if it weren't chaotic,
it probably wouldn't be a properly entrepreneurial business.

Let's say you've come up with the genius idea of a social network for
pets. Nobody has done this before! There might be a good reason! Is it a
good idea? Who knows. The only real way to find out is to do it.

Reason #2 - misapplying a different problem space

What happens if you treat flying a passenger airliner as if it's baking
a cake? Bad things probably. Treating a complicated problem like it's a
simple problem doesn't work that well. Treating a complex problem, like
software development, as if it's a complicated problem doesn't work
that well either. Trying to manage the chaotic space with the kinds of
approaches that work in the complex space doesn't work. But I've just
realised, this isn't chaos. This is what Dave Snowdon (the developer of
the Cynefin framework) puts in the middle of the Cynefin diagram. It's
the black hole in the middle.

This isn't chaos, this is disorder. It isn't chaos that I'm scared
of. It's disorder.

What's the difference between chaos and disorder? In chaos, there is an
understanding, even if it's tacit, that the environment that you're in
is chaotic. In disorder, the wrong kind of methods are being wilfully,
sometimes desperately applied.

### Connections

The screenwriter William Goldman, the man who wrote the script for
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", said in his book "Notes from the
Screen Trade" that "No one knows anything."

He was, of course, talking about the film industry. And what he's saying
is slightly strange, because of course, lots of the people who are
involved in making films know lots of things. There probably aren't many
simple skills involved in filmmaking, but there are lots of complicated
skills. Make-up? Special effects, sound, lighting and cinematography --
these are all skills that are complicated but can be learned. Then there
are some skills which, when they're put together have a good chance of
working but can't be guaranteed to work. We might put acting, directing
and the fundamentals of screen writing in this category

But there's one aspect of film-making that is always going to be, to
some degree, chaotic -- it's reception. This is a huge risk for movie
studios and the people whose reputation is attached to the film being a
success.

### Concrete Practice

The concrete practices for this are the core pillars of the empirical
process that we've already talked about repeatedly. Transparency,
inspection and adaptation. And also working software. Pushing working
software as far as possible towards its real users with real data making
real transactions.

### Conclusion

I'm not scared of chaos. I'm scared of disorder. Actually, I think
that might be bollocks. I think, like most people, I have a healthy fear
of chaos. With chaos comes the possibility of success and failure
without rhyme or reason. Also, most people have a healthy fear of
failure. And people like things to happen for a reason. This is why
there are now lots of films that are sequels, this is why there are now
some many films that are part of a "universe".

What does drive me crazy is people trying to control chaos using the
wrong methods. Simple methods won't work in the chaotic space.
Complicated methods won't work in the chaotic space. Complex methods
won't work in the chaotic space. But the fundamentals of an Agile
approach, inspection, adaptation and iterative and incremental
delivering of working software. Those all do work.

If you've developed a new product, there's a good chance that you're in
a chaotic space, in some sense, you're *there* for the chaos. Even
though you're telling yourself that you're not. You're there because.
But if you're in the "disorder plughole" in the middle of the Cynefin
framework, you're there because somebody really doesn't understand
what's going on.

### The system as imagined vs the system as found

Imagine a triangle. The triangle is your project. Now imagine that there
are forces pushing on the triangle. One of those forces is for functions
-- stuff. There's pressure from the people who want this thing for it to
happen for it to do stuff that works in the world. Then there's another
pressure on another side of the triangle. This is a bit weird, it's a
negative pressure, a pressure to do this stuff with as few resources as
possible. Fast and cheap. So, there's pressure to do stuff, and there's
pressure to do it quickly and cheaply. But then there's also pressure
from the third side of the triangle. There's pressure to do it safely.
Safety. What kind of safety? Well, if the software is for an aeroplane,
it might be the "get it wrong everybody dies" kind of safety. If the
software is for a financial institution, it might be the "get it wrong
everybody loses their money" kind of safety. But there are lots of other
kinds of safety. Loss of reputation, getting in trouble with the
regulators.

Beyond that safety line, is the real world. It's where bad things
happen, like planes falling out of the sky and banks losing all of their
money. It's also where all the good stuff happens, planes fly to exotic
destinations. People get to spend and send money how they want. Pictures
of cats doing funny stuff get shared all around the world.

And so we're left with a tricky question. Where is the right place to be
on this safety side of the triangle?

## Chapter EGG - Fried Egg Agile -- with knobs on
===================================================

Agile is a collection of lightweight, empirical methodologies. The way you do it for your team will be slightly different than the way others do it with their team. That's fine. In this chapter, I share what has worked for me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I saw a TV programme by the chef Rick Stein. He said that whenever he
interviews a chef who might work in one of his restaurants, he asks him
to fry an egg. Stein says that all the best chefs - the ones that he's
likely to hire - do the same thing. It isn't that they fry the egg in
the same way. It's that they have the same attitude to it. They shrug
and say something like "I don't know how you fry an egg. This is the
way that I do it."

You can tell a lot about a person by how they do the simple things in
your line of work. But there are a lot of ways doing it right.

There are many ways of frying an egg. There is also more than one way of
running even the basic aspects of an Agile project. So, here's my
description of how I do the Agile equivalent of frying an egg. But here
is also a description of the "knobs" -- the variables that you can
change depending on your circumstances to make sure that these tools fit
with the circumstances.

### Concepts

Initially, examples of good ideas that work look a lot like each other.
One car looks a lot like another. One aeroplane looks a lot like
another. There's a central idea that works and everyone sticks to that.

But then after a while, that central idea gets adapted in different
ways. Think of all the different kinds of cars that there can be. You
can have really fast cars. Really stylish cars. You can have huge cars
(like the dumper trucks that are used in quarries). The designers of
cars start to realise that there are parameters -- knobs - that they can
tweak.

#### Meetings

There are four meetings.

1. Stand up

2. Planning

3. Show and Tell (or Sprint Showcase, or Sprint Demo)

4. Retrospective

##### Stand up

For me the power of Scrum is that it tells you to do some simple things
-- meetings. And it tells you to have some things and they are quite
simple things - artefacts.

The first thing to start doing with any team that you're working with
is to have a standup. The standup is a meeting that happens at the same
time every working day in the same place.

The original idea of the standup was just that. The participants should
stand up. And the idea behind this is that standing up discourages long
conversations. I think there might also be something else about standups
that was pretty powerful. They involved a change in stance.

Even so, I still think there's a lot to be said for the act of standing
up. It's doing something *different* from what the team does for the
rest of the day. I think there is some power to the simple act of
adopting a different physical stance when you do something.

Anyway. Get your team together and get each of them to roughly answer
these three questions. What did they do yesterday, or the last working
day? What are they going to do today? And is there anything that's
blocking them? That means, is there anything that's stopping them from
doing what they want to do?

And try to keep the whole thing under 20 minutes. Try to push things
forward if there are obvious digressions. Sick cats? Sympathy yes, long
discussion of ailments no. Someone's team did well in the sports? Brief
chuckle yes, blow by blow analysis, no. Somebody mentions a problem that
you think you know how to solve? Agreement to talk to them in detail
about it after standup yes. Getting right into the nitty gritty right
there in the meeting? No.

That's it. I don't know what the Scrum guide says these days. Maybe it
says something different. The stuff I've just described?

##### Planning

Get the team together and discuss what you're going to do in the next
fixed period. The world seems to have settled on two weeks as the agreed
fixed length of time. And I don't have much against it, except to point
out that in my experience, sometimes work is obviously moving on a
larger "cadence". By that I mean on a different rhythm, a different
fixed period, to a different beat. And it's worth noticing these
cadences as the team progresses and to discuss with the team what you
want to do about them.

Sometimes things are so crazy that a week works better. I avoid any
options other than multiples of seven days, because calendar arithmetic
is beyond me. And I truly believe in the power of getting into the
rhythm. If this is Wednesday and it wasn't planning last Wednesday, it
must be planning today. That's it. That's all the effort anyone should
ever need to put into figuring out if today is planning day or not.

People are such dicks about commitment consistency. See the chapter
[chapter ref] about your other boss, reality if you don't believe me.
And for this reason, I don't push planning as being any kind of
commitment. Again, this might seem like a heresy. There is this idea
that the team should plan what they're doing in the sprint and then
"move heaven and earth" to do it.

Do you know what "moving heaven and earth," means? It means working
late, it means missing lunch, it means doing something other than
working at a sustainable pace. And so it probably means making mistakes
or taking short cuts. It probably means making the project harder to
manage, harder to deliver and certainly much harder and more unpleasant
to work on.

It's really easy to fall into the trap of thinking that rushing to meet
deadlines *is* real work.

A long time ago I read a book called *Sources of Power* by Gary Klein.
Klein spent a lot of time studying people who really know what they're
doing. Experts. The book is a series of examples of critical situations
where experts worked successfully and their expertise won out. One
distinction that Iremember he draws is that a strong indication that
you're in the presence of an expert is that they know what they're
capable of.

Of course, experts weren't born magically knowing what they're capable
of. They had to learn over time. Learning what they're capable of is a
fundamental part of their expertise. And it's the same with teams.

Teams, including the product owner, will initially tend to plan too
much. Of course, when this happens, it's important to make this clear
at the end of every sprint. But not in any kind of accusatory tone,
rather as point of practicality. "We planned thirty things. We finished
twenty things. Do you think there's much point in planning more than
about twenty-five things this sprint?"

Here's something I hope that all the people involved with the team can
understand. This includes the developers and the product owner. Let's
look back to the previous planning meeting. When we got to the point
where were discussing issues number 21, 22, 23, but especially when we
were discussing numbers 26, 27, 28, we were just wasting our time.
Because we were talking about things that just weren't going to happen
in that sprint.

One thing that I never used to bother with was a sprint goal. But in
recent projects I've found a sprint goal, or goals, extremely useful.

Why? Because they're a good way of describing to people outside of the
team what the team is doing. If a goal is something like "Release
candidate for Feature X", I think that's a good goal. But also,
"Start Feature Y." For me, that's a good goal.

There's an argument that often surfaces when you first talk about goals
that goals should be "SMART".

There are variations on what this acronym stands for, but it's something
like: specific, measurable, achievable (or attainable), relevant, and
time-bound.

So often some of the members of the team will baulk at a goal like
"Start feature Y," because they'll say that it's not measurable.

I simply don't agree. The team will absolutely know if they've started
a feature or not. And at the end of the sprint, if the goal has been
met, that's useful information. If the goal hasn't been met - if the
feature didn't get started - that's also useful information.

Fiddling with the knobs.

At some point it will dawn on you that a lot of these things, focus on
detail in stories, focus on a general goal for the sprint, the emphasis
that you put on delivering stories within a sprint, the frequency that
you plan, the focus that you put on estimating the complexity of the
stories that you plan. When you've been on a few projects, you're start
to notice that where these where these knobs and dials are set is
different for each project.

If things are a bit too slack, well then tighten them up. Set up some
meetings during the sprint that ensure that stories for the next sprint
have sufficient detail. If you get to planning and it turns out that the
detail in the stories was either impossible to fill in, or wrong because
there's too much uncertainty, well the loosen things up. With the team,
set some more general goals for the sprint.

And all of this, needs judgement. But there are obvious things to look
for. If hardly is getting finished, radically reduce the amount of work
that you plan. If the team are running out of work half-way through the
sprint -- well, then plan more. If there seem to be endless discussions
about what precisely goes in a story, as I said mentioned, put more work
into refining those stories before they get planned, but on the other
hand, if, when the developers get to a ticket, a lot of the detail
that's in it is wrong, or needs revising because of new information
that's come to light, it's OK to reduce the detail.

##### Show and Tell

Demonstrate the working software to people who might care. That will
probably be the product owner. It might be other people related to the
project, all sorts of people who have an interest in the swamp.

Understand that dealing with feedback is, at least, a two-step process.

The first step is capturing the feedback. It's very important that you
show that you're listening. Write down the feedback from every show and
tell.

The second step is to decide what to do about the feedback. That's
something for the product owner, primarily, and possibly the rest of the
team.

What you're doing by having a show and tell is fulfilling the
"transparency" and "inspection" aspects of empirical process.

What that really means is that if you've done something dumb, someone
is going to tell you. Also, if you've missed something important,
someone is going to tell you. That's what you're hoping for. That's
the payoff.

But this isn't just a negative thing. You might find out in the show
and tell that you've just done something that will make people's lives
much easier. Your team might just have done something that marketing
think they can make a lot of money from, or win a big reputational
improvement. You might get to know that if it weren't for the show and
tell.

The price for getting this valuable information is that people might say
stupid things. We demonstrated an application that helped a bunch of
users fill in a big, complex form. We were asked this question: "Can
you make it so that users aren't allowed to submit the form if the
English has spelling or grammatical errors?" To some people this might
sound like a great idea, if the answers that you're supposed to put in
those boxes contains the names of chemical compounds and scientific
formulae, it gets a bit more tricky.

This isn't too serious. But it can get a little wearing.

What can be more of a problem is that by showing working software you
can unearth a real conflict in the organisation. You want to avoid
putting controversy in the software. Which means you need to surface the
controversy before it gets in there. But this can be a rough ride.

So, feedback, no matter how brutal, non-sensical or contradictory, is
the first reason that you're having a show and tell.

What's the second reason? The second reason is working software. If you
have a meeting where you're supposed to demonstrate working software,
it's going to become obvious if you aren't demonstrating any.

If you've read and remembered the chapter about exploring the swamp,
you'll recall that these were the two activities that I recommended.
Drawing a map that shows the people who live in the swamp and the people
who care about the swamp. Exploring values and creating pull with
working software.

On a healthy project, on a project that is really working well, both of
those activities are happening in separate sessions that have been
arranged with users and stakeholders. On a project that isn't working so
well, they both happen in the show and tell, it's important to the
health of any project that we make sure that they happen there.

It's important that the show and tell works well. You need a good
subset of the stakeholders to pay attention to what new things are going
into the software. If the team isn't demonstrating new working software
on a regular basis, you're creating a problem for the future.

What kind of problem? Well, maybe the team isn't really building
anything. That's one kind of problem. Maybe they're struggling so
badly with a bunch of different issues that they're not managing to get
anything to the point where they can demonstrate it. If the team can't
demonstrate any working software, they can't create enthusiasm and pull
from the users. They can't get an important signal about what's
valuable about what they're doing.

But, even worse, maybe the team do have working software to demonstrate,
but because no one is looking at it, it's the wrong thing.

##### Retro

The retrospective is a chance for the team to express how they feel
about how things are going.

Yes, notionally, it's supposed to be a more forensic look at what went
on in the last sprint. But really, I want it to be a meeting in which
the team get chance to vent.

If there are definite actions that come out of it, that's great. If
there is a short list of things that need to change that can be taken to
senior management, also great.

You will be able to find lots of descriptions of how to run a perfect
retrospective. There is one thing that it's important to understand. If
you're not willing to get it wrong by trying different ways of running
retrospectives, you probably won't get it right.

##### Other meetings that I find helpful

These are some other meetings that I find useful. I'm not saying
you'll need these for your teams. I'm not saying that *at all*. But
I find them useful on some teams.

###### Mid Sprint Check

I find it useful in the middle of a sprint to have a meeting where the
team just gets together for half an hour and checks in to see how things
are going.

Here are two or three things that I do in that meeting.

1. Check the goals - we set some goals at the beginning of the sprint,
in planning. How are we doing against those goals? Sometimes, I know
this sounds crazy, but we'll all have forgotten what the goals were!

2. Looking at the list of stuff still to do in the sprint, does any of
it now seem impossible? Have we found out things that mean that
something just can't be done? What do we want to do about that? Is
there someone we need to tell.

3. Look at the roadmap.

###### Risks and Issues

This is a new one that I learnt on my last project. My heart sank
because I was told that I needed to report risks for my project every
week.

My experience of risk registers is that they aren't useful. They tend
to become, almost instantly, "information fridges." A place where
information goes to remain unchanged and unnoticed and have no effect.

But my product owner was an employee of the organisation and wanted to
make sure that we were doing everything we could to show good
governance. He found a description of an Agile approach to risk
management that I had no problem getting behind.

Each sprint we'd meet with the senior stakeholder. For half an hour
we'd walk through a Kanban board of risks. Each risk would be scored
using an "exposure" score. This was worked out multiplying the cost of
the risk happening and the chance of it happening.

For example:

Risk: We don't deliver the service on time.

Cost (in days for the whole team): 40

Percentage chance: 30%

Total Exposure score: 1200

Of course, the scores are (almost) complete hokum.

But having a short meeting every fortnight where we discussed what was
worrying the senior stakeholders? That was useful. And that's what this
meeting allowed us to do. It was also a way of us gently raising our own
concerns. But it was also a way of doing research into what is happening
in the organisation. What's going on with the owners of the swamp? Very
often, this isn't something that stakeholders will tell you straight
out. But, for example, let's say that a risk gets added to this list
which is something like "There is no funding beyond December" (and it's
October). And this issue starts off with a high score. Discussing this
single item, even if it's only every two weeks, tells you a lot about
what's going on in the organisation.

If, over time the risk of no more money goes up -- well, that's very
useful information! If the risk goes down, it tells you that there's
commitment for the project inside the organisation.

The knobs? So, what are the knobs and dials on having a risks and issues
chart. Firstly, I think the score. The exposure score was a great start.
And what I like about the number is that you can then put together a
chart that has an overall number. If the overall "risk score" for the
project is going up, well, that's something else to talk to the product
owner and stakeholders about. Similarly, if it's going down, or even if
it's all over the place. I haven't actually tried this (yet) but I think
another kind of score might be better. Something that goes like this.

1 = Mildly irritating

2 = Irritating

4 = Mildly annoying

8 = Annoying

16 = Worrying

32 = Very worrying

64 = Bad

128 = Very bad

256 = Disastrous

512 = Catastrophic

1024 = End of the world / the project / the company

Even talking about what the names of these scores would be with the
product owner and stakeholders would be interesting -- it might be a way
of getting them to name their worst fears.

But there are other aspects of the risks and issues meeting that can be
varied. Who turns up to the meetings? Is it just the product owner? Or
are there more senior stakeholders who would like to turn up? Maybe they
can only come once a month? Who gets to see the chart? Is it just talked
about in the risks and issues meeting? Or does it go in the weekly
report?

###### Backlog refinement

There are lots of different ways of doings this. On any project that I'm
working on, I'm expecting this to evolve through the course of a
project. There is the "Three Amigos" approach. Several members of the
team maybe a designer, a developer and a user researcher, get together
once a week. They look at the project to do list. They discuss from the
point of view of their discipline what might be the challenges with
items in the to do list. Technically, is this possible? What else do we
need to know? From a user research point of view, what might we need to
explore before we develop it? From a design point of view, is there
anything new and different? And of course, from a business point of
view, why is this important?

In my experience, this might be needed early on. So that these points of
view are made clear to the other "amigos." But over time, this can be
streamlined, and the reviews of the project to do list might only need
the product owner and the Scrum Master. Maybe. Think about it this way.
Part of the work that you're doing on a project is figuring out what
shape the work is in. Where does the work need detail and specification
up front? Where can it be left to be figured out as it's picked up to
be developed.

Which bits need to be explored using user research and testing? How
much? Where? With whom? Which bits need a lot of design thinking and
input. Which bits can be developed without much design input?

###### (On live services) Support board

So, you went through the whole heartache and pain of developing a
service to the point that it went live.

Congratulations! Now you have to maintain it.

One thing I've found useful on a recent project is a regular weekly
meeting where we look at the support tickets. These are the tickets that
have been raised as a result of issues reported to a support email
address. By the time we look at it, all of the frequently asked
questions have been filtered out and replied to by the team that read
the emails. What we're left with are either bugs or feature requests.
Part of what we do in this meeting is decide which of these the issues
are. If we decide something is a bug, we then decide on some kind of
urgency for fixing it.

#### That's a *lot* of meetings

Yes, I know that this is a lot of meetings. And I'm not suggesting that
you need all, or any, of these. You might need a different meeting. In
fact, what you need to be doing all the way through your project is
inspecting and and adapting on your inspecting and adapting. Yes, that's
right, you need to be continuously using transparency, inspection and
adaptation to change these meetings if you see the need.

#### Artefacts

So, you've got your four meetings. What else do you need?

For me there are two, (ok, maybe three or four) artefacts.

1. To do list items.

2. The to do list

3. Maybe a roadmap

4. Maybe a burnup chart

5. An emerging definition of ready and done

##### Stories

At the beginning of a project, I'm very happy to start collecting a
list of any things that need doing.

And I don't want to be too prescriptive about what kinds of things are
allowed to go on that list.

Why am I not saying the "S" word? Why am I not saying stories? Not
because I don't think you should call them stories, I'm fine with
calling them stories. I'm also fine drawing distinctions between tasks,
bugs and stories. Roughly a task is something that needs doing that
isn't going to change the functionality of the code. Make some changes
to the cloud server architecture? That's a task. Run a one-off report
from the database, that's a task.

A story is something that, when it's done, will result in the software
doing something differently. "Add middle name to sign-up page" - for
me that's a story.

Am I going to say that all stories should be of the form "As an X, I
can Y, so that Z"? No, I'm not saying that. Why?

Because I think the team need to get a feel together for what
constitutes a well-formed story. It's fine for them, together to agree
on a story of the form: "As an X, I can Y, so that Z." It's fine for
the team to come up with that as a suggestion - or for you to suggest
it, if they're really struggling. It's not fine to insist on it. It's
especially *not* fine to insist that everything is in this form.
Insisting that everything must be a story rather than just a thing that
needs talking about. That's not fine. Insisting that all stories must
be of the form "As an X, I can Y, so that Z." That's not fine.

And drawing distinctions between stories and bugs. I'm also fine with
this. Once you get going, this is fine. Roughly, a story is a change
that the product owner wants to make to the way the software behaves to
make it do something new. A bug is something that went wrong. The
software doesn't work as expected.

So, "When I click on this button, I get an error" is a bug.

"Add help text that appears when I hover over this button" is a story.

And there are two other kinds of items that you might find in a backlog.

A task is something that needs doing which isn't directly going to
affect the behaviour of the software "Book the accessibility
assessment".

And there's a final type of story -- "Epic". I've got to admit I'm a bit
leery of epics. The idea is that an Epic is a BIG story (geddit), but
also that an epic is a collection of stories.

##### The project to do list (or backlog)

The only other thing that you *really* need is a list of things to do.

What you do in planning is that you look at that list of things to do
with the team and the product owner and decide, all together, on a
shorter list. The sprint to do list. These are the things that the team
is going to do in this sprint.

And where do you put this list of things to do? To be honest, I've got
a way that I like to do it. But I try not to force them on the team.
This is tricky because most of these tools aren't free. They involve
signing up to something and spending money. But I think the team should
figure out all together what kind of thing they should use to
communicate.

They might want to start out with a spreadsheet, but somebody will
probably find out quite soon that that's too difficult to maintain.
They might want to start out with a physical wall, but in these days of
everyone working from home, I'm not sure how you could make that work.

I'm going to come out and admit that I like Jira. Well, I don't really
like it.I curse it a lot. But it seems to be the best application for
keeping track of the status of an issue. Also, it seems to be pretty
good at keeping hold of the discussion that's gone on around an issue.

##### A roadmap

I've found that roadmaps can be very useful. They don't have to be
perfect to start with. What they do need is some kind of regular cadence
to make sure that they're maintained.

Any kind of tool that can be used to make a Kanban board (Trello or even
Jira) works for this. All you need is a list of the big things that need
to go into the product. They you need a way of ordering them so that
some of these things are being dealt with "Now." Then some of them are
"Next." Finally, some of them are "Later." You might also have a
column for "Done."

As I said, this is fine also, so long as it's maintained. If it's
written once and then never looked at, it's just been thrown in the
bin, it's a waste of time.

One occasion that I've found works well, for looking at the roadmap, is
the mid-sprint check. I don't know quite why I've found that this
works, but it does. After checking how things are going in the current
sprint, the team, gets to lift their head up and look at the roadmap.
Actually, what the team does with the roadmap leads me on to my nearly
final artefact "A burnup chart"

##### Maybe a burnup

It's interesting that this might be a bit of "Agile" practice that I
like best. It's the bit that has worked well frequently for me. But
it's also the bit that I'm a bit ashamed of and a bit nervous about.
It's also something that I feel might get me drummed out of the Scrum
Master guild or whatever the secret society of Scrum Masters would be
called.

Here's the situation. We were six or seven months into a greenfield,
brand new, project. There'd been some vague discussions at the
beginning of the project about deadlines, but no definite date had been
mentioned. Then, all of a sudden, there was an absolutely definite date.
Fortunately, it was about twelve months away. But by that deadline date
we had to have a system that could do enough of what the existing system
did to turn the old system off and the new system on.

The minute I heard this, I knew that there were substantial features
that we just weren't going to be able to deliver for the deadline. I
knew that, if we were to have a chance of meeting that deadline, we
would also need to drastically reduce, not only the list of features,
but what we did for any particular feature.

In Agile language, what we needed to do was reduce the scope. Not just
in terms of the numbers of stories we implemented, but also internally,
we need to reduce the scope of the stories that we implemented.

But there was a problem. I'd tried to do this before. And I knew that
discussions around scope reduction were always extremely painful. But it
was something that I had to do if the project had any chance of being a
success. I also knew that pointing out that there was no way that the
promised scope could be delivered by a particular deadline had gotten me
fired from jobs in the past. Yes, fired.

I liked this project, I really liked the people I was working with, I
didn't want to be fired.

So, here's what I did, over the course of about three months.

I ran a workshop with the team and the product owner. We listed out all
the features that we could think of that the product needed to do.

Then we did a "bucket" sort on the complexity of those features. Using
the Fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where the next number in the
series is generated by adding the previous two numbers in the series.
So, strictly speaking, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci series are
1 and 1. Getting started with the Fibonacci series is a bit weird. But
once we get going, it's more straight-forward.

>> 1+1 = 2

>> 2+1 = 3

>> 3+2 = 5

>> 5+3 = 8

and so on. This results in this series.

>> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

Of course, you can keep going. But for the purposes of the job I'm
describing, these numbers are normally sufficient.

So, what you end up with at the end of this session is a wall (real, or
virtual) that has big ticket items on it.

And all these big ticket items are grouped under Fibonacci series
numbers.

This is the really important bit. You add up the total of the scores on
all of the tickets. This gives you an overall number for the size of the
to do list.

*This gives you important number 1 -- the total number of points in the
backlog.*

Then what you need to know is a rough order of priority for these "big
ticket" items. A really easy way to do this is use a package like Trello
to create a Kanban board with four columns and then label those columns
"Done", "Now", "Next", "Later". The next job is for either the
product owner or the product owner together with the whole team to put
those tickets in those columns. When you've done that, you have a sized
and roughly prioritised road map.

Then every fortnight at the end of the mid-sprint check I would walk
through the Kanban board. I asked the team to estimate the percentage
completion of the things that were in the "Now" column. I multiplied
the percentage complete scores that I got from the team by the fibbonaci
numbers on the ticket items. And that gets me important number 2 -- the
number of points in the backlog completed in a particular fortnight.

Important number #2 is the number of points that have been
"completed".

Warning: a lot of people will tell you that this is absolutely what you
shouldn't do. I'm kind of worried even to admit this is what I've
done. Even though it worked beautifully for me. And I will definitely
try it again. This is the particular way that I fry an egg. Actually,
this is the particular way that I fried an egg on a particular occasion.

Before you know it, another two weeks have gone by. You're sitting in
the mid-sprint check with the team looking at their big ticket items and
asking for estimates on percentage progress. This mid-sprint check and
all the others that follow it start to give you important numbers three,
four, five and six. So, 8 weeks into a software development project you
have all the numbers you need to really cause some trouble.

You could even get yourself fired. Why? Because now you have the numbers
to put together a burn up chart and a burn up chart gives you some kind
of indication when the project might actually finish.

And guess what? The news is never good. the news is never "Oh look!"
We're going to have this finished in about half the time!

After three or four sprints 6 to 8 weeks you have a pretty good idea of
how much work there is and how quickly the team are getting through it.
Of course, the first reaction of product owners and stakeholders will be
denial. The second will be some kind of bargaining; actually this
normally takes the form of some kind of bad arithmetic.

"Yes, but if you add all these numbers together divide them by this you
get X. Then take away the number you first thought and add in the
*special Mayan number for fate and good luck* you get Y. And Y is the
number that shows we'll get everything done on time."

The more eagle-eyed amongst you will realise that what's happening here
is that we're walking through the five stages of grief: denial,
bargaining, anger, depression and acceptance.

In my experience the bargaining stage is where people say the maddest
stuff. I used to argue with them. When they said, "we're still going
to be able to deliver for the deadline. All we have to do is work twice
as fast," I used to argue with them. When they said, "I talked to this
crazy person on the street. They said that this project is easy. They
said you don't know what you're talking about," or "my nephew put up
a website in a weekend I don't see why this is any different."

Now what I do, is I just keep counting. Another two weeks you have
another data point. You put that on your chart and things will become
clearer. Now it's obvious. You have twice, three times, four times --
the worst I've seen is seven times - more work than you can deliver in
the time required.

And that's when the anger will come in. Why are you being so negative?
Why didn't you tell me about this before? "I thought I'd hired
professional people who knew what they were doing. Clearly if this is
going to take twice as long as I want it to you can't possibly know
what you're doing."

There might also at this point be an attempt to change the way that you
count things so that things look better than they are. It's quite
important to resist this. How do I know? Because I've failed to resist
it and then I've seen what happens when you don't.

It was a long time after my first attempt at this manoeuvre that I read
*Never Split the Difference*, by Chris Voss.

Now having read that, I realised what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to
show the product owner and the senior stakeholders a realistic picture
of the project. Then I'm asking them an open question.

What do you want us to do?

The difficult bit of this is dealing with the answers that come back
that won't work.

So we often start with denial.

"I don't see what the problem is, if only you and your team could be
more positive about this, I'm sure you could manage to deliver things
on time."

Then we get anger.

"I thought I'd hired a professional team? But clearly it looks like
you're not up to the job."

Then we get some sort of bargaining. Often at first it's a bit
ineffective.

"If we let you have some help from our new intern, do you think that
would speed things up?"

It may not sound like it, but depression is a sign of progress.

"I am totally regretting this project. This is the worst project I've
ever worked on. OK. What do we do?"

And then finally. Finally, we get to acceptance.

"We can probably do without feature G at launch if we know that it's
going to be coming very quickly afterwards. And we only need a tiny bit
of feature C. If we just had these bits of feature D and feature E, we
could probably manage with the old system for just a bit longer."

OK, that's the dream kind of acceptance.

What really happens is that ~~it~~ often ~~comes~~ (as I'm sure is also
the case with grief about other, more important aspects of life). ~~Is
that~~ the acceptance stage, if it comes at all, comes mixed up with
anger, bargain, denial and depression.

"OK, we can schedule that feature for after release - but when I signed
you guys up, I thought you knew what you were doing. And I'm still
seeing some of you going home at about 5:30pm, looking relaxed, as if
you don't have a care in the world. And Jeff? Yesterday, I saw Jeff
took a whole hour for lunch! I would never have done this if I'd known
it was going to take this long. Oh my God software is expensive. Are you
sure there's no way we could just do this faster? Are you sure more
people wouldn't help?"

That? That's what success sounds like.

##### Definition of Ready, Definition of Done

What about a definition of ready? I don't have one. That is, I don't
insist on one. Again, as I write this, I'm aware that it's the kind of
thing that could get you drummed out of the Scrum Masters' guild.

The idea of the definition of ready is that it's a checklist of things
that need to be in a story before it's ready to be planned in a sprint.

Trouble is, I don't have a degree in computer science, I have a degree
in philosophy. Philosophers start with Plato. There are others before
him, like there are other rock and roll singers before Elvis, but you
get the idea. The problem is that when you read Plato, you get to see
the trouble that he gets himself into trying to think about very basic
ideas like "true" and "good." And a lot of that trouble comes from
trying to solve the problem by coming up with definitions. This makes me
very suspicious of an approach to solving problems that starts out with
"first write your definitions."

So, I'm kind of fine with a definition of ready. I just don't want it
to be written down. Or if it is, I want the word draft written across it
and I want to revisit regularly. I want it to emerge through practice. I
want it to emerge through a discussion between the people who are
writing the stories and the people who are developing the stories. And
if as part of the process of discussing what needs to be an story before
it's ready for development, they realised that, the main this is that
there needs to be regular conversation between the people who write the
story and the people who develop the story, I'm more than fine with
that. For anyone interested, this is a Wittgensteinian approach rather
than a Platonic one.

I'm not saying that we should forbid anybody from writing things down.
But if the team notice that they don't have anything to plan. And the
reason for this is because none of the items in the to do list are
"ready" according to their own definition of ready, well, I might
suggest they don't focus so much on the "definition of ready". Rather
they just have a chat about the things that are most nearly "ready".
What would need to happen to them for them to be ready?

And so you, might have already figured out what I'm going to say about
"definition of done"? Something very similar.

### Concrete Practice -- cook for yourself

On the projects that you work on, there will be a tweaked version of
Scrum, that will perform better that the "ideal" one that is generally
talked about. It might be the length of the sprint. The whole world
seems to have settled on two weeks, but the initial books talked about a
month. For some projects, the best sprint length might be a week. It's
probably best if it's a whole number of weeks. I've seen projects that
have tried a different number of days. An awful lot of time then ends up
being spent trying to figure out when the current sprint starts and when
it ends.

You can dispense with that "cadence" completely, or have daily
sprints. I'm only really comfortable using daily sprints with teams
that are working on support projects. That's when it's possible that
urgent things might come in at any time that will need to be dealt with
immediately.

So, the length of sprint. That's definitely a knob on the scrum. Once
you realise that it's a knob, you can talk together as a team about
changing it.

Another knob that you can turn is the depth of the backlog. What do I
mean by that? I mean how long is the list of stories, issues, to do
items, whatever you want to call them. How long is the list of things
that need to be done on the project? On some projects, this list will be
everything that anyone can imagine being part of the project. On some
projects, it will be only a list of things necessary for the project to
go live. On some projects, the backlog might be even shorter than that.
While the current sprint is running, what's going to go into the to do
list for the next sprint is still being discussed.

And of course, both kinds of backlogs have benefits. A long to backlog
would be one that captures either everything that needs to be delivered,
or everything that could be delivered. It gives a sense of completeness.
It's also relatively easy to use backlogsto predict when a project is
going to be delivered, and to negotiate changes in deadline or changes
in scope.

Alternatively, working off a short to do list is useful for projects
that are trying to negotiate uncertain times. This allows a team to
change direction quickly and to incorporate new ideas as they emerge
from research

We want reliability and manoeuvrability in both cars and projects. We'd
also probably like speed. But the fastest cars aren't the most
reliable, or the easiest to steer. And it's the same with projects. A
project that's set up to be manoeuvrable probably won't be the most
reliable and the fastest.

There's also another knob on the to do list. Actually, there might be
two. That's the required depth of detail and maturity in its stories.
Sometimes this is known as the definition of ready.

How complex and detailed the definition of ready is, is something that
can vary. It's a knob. On some projects the definition of ready may
need to be *very* detailed indeed. Maybe all the content needs to have
been combed by lawyers before it can be put in the story. Maybe each
story needs a list of acceptance criteria and conditions of
satisfaction. These need to be there so that tests for the story can be
written at the same time as the story is being developed. Maybe the
story needs to go through several different refinement stages before
it's ready to be "developed." These could be user, research or
design. For some companies, there might be also stages with risk and
legal.

Maybe. But maybe a story can also be a single line. Each approach has
its advantages and disadvantages. There is a level of detail which is
"just right" for a story which will mean that the story encounters the
minimum of trouble as it goes through development. But the definition of
ready can get so complex that no story is ever "ready." And progress
grinds to a halt. Alternatively, the description of the story can be so
vague that no one knows what it means. Lightweight descriptions can also
mean that *something* gets developed quickly. Users get to see working
software. They get to use it and respond to it. They point out bugs.
They are excited about some parts and bored with others. The stage is
set for another, better, next iteration.

Beyond agreement about how detailed any given story should be, there's
a separate discussion about the gradient of this detail.

What? How many stories are fully detailed? How many stories are
partially detailed? How many stories have no detail at all?

These might seem like insignificant questions. But they're not. Actively
managing the profile of your backlog is one of the best ways to use a
backlog to make sure that a project can be delivered on time.

### Conclusion

Everything about Agile is about facilitating the empirical process. The
agile meetings are about transparency and inspection (standup, show and
tell, retrospective) and inspection and adaptation (show and tell,
planning).

## Chapter SAFETY - Psychological Safety for you, your team and your Boss, for everyone
=========================================================================================

In a very early chapter [Agreed Activity] we talked about agreed
activity. The phenomenon of doing something that seems safe. Doing
something that seems safe, rather than doing something that helps a
project and moves it forward. Then we talked about the antidote to
agreed activity - creating psychological safety.

One of the things that bothered me when I was reading the Timothy
Clark's book on psychological safety. In quite a lot of the stories in
that book the boss didn't look good, in fact, the boss looked
frightened. And the boss's fear was the reason that psychological safety
didn't emerge in the team.

A thought drifted vaguely through my mind. If *everybody* has a need
to feel psychologically safe, well then, *everybody* also applies to
leaders and bosses. The thought also occurred to me that what
constitutes psychological safety might be different for bosses than it
is for team members.

Looking at things in this way provided me with a different way of
looking at some of the very worst experiences I've had whilst working
as a project manager. And it also made me realise if you're a project
manager, you ignore the psychological safety of your bosses at your
peril.

### Concept

So, let's just remind ourselves what the four levels of psychological
safety are that Clark talks about in his book.

1. Membership Safety

2. Learning Safety

3. Contribution Safety

4. Criticism Safety

And let's just take these one by one and think about what these mean if
you have some kind of leadership role.

1. Membership Safety - showing the boss that they're the boss

It isn't enough to be a member of the team if you're the boss. You
have to have everyone in your team recognise that you're the boss. But
as with membership safety, this is just the first, fundamental level of
safety that a boss needs. No one can usefully participate in a team
unless they feel they are part of the team. And no boss can usefully
provide leadership if there's any doubt about their authority.

This is a problem for bosses in software development for two reasons.
First, all of the people who are actually doing the work know how to do
the work better than the boss.

Second, in software development, reality is your other boss. If you're
doing it properly as a team (i.e. using Agile, iterative methods), you
will soon discover the really hard problems that need solving. It will
be very difficult to air these problems without undermining the
authority of the boss.

And here we uncover a central contradiction of project management. It's
one that you're not going to ever resolve. The best that you can hope
for is that you're going to be able to manage it.

>> The thing that you have to do to get the project done is the thing
that you should never do to your boss (i.e. point out the fundamental
problems with their ideas).

2. Learning Safety

Leaders need to feel safe to learn. But somehow part of the rules of
being a leader is that they can't simply go to school. They can't take
a course or sit at the feet of the expert who actually knows. So again,
the team is faced with a paradox. They need to figure out ways to teach
their leaders what they need to know. And they need to do this without
flagging what they're doing as teaching. They can't make it too clear
that it's obvious that there are certain areas where the leader in
lacking in knowledge.

Of course, to some degree, the things that a leader is discovering about
the project are the same things that the team are discovering about the
project. What is easy? What is hard? What aspects of the project are
genuinely appealing to users. What aspects of the project are totally
uninteresting to users. Which other groups of people care about the
project, or have regulatory power over it. But it's very possible that,
for the leader, learning these things is not going to result in a safe
experience.

The project is going to cost way more than the leader expected. The
project is going to take a lot longer than the leader expected.
Potential users don't seem that excited by it, or are actively hostile
to it. It turns out that there is a regulator that, if you don't make
expensive changes, could stop the project dead in its tracks.

Yes, this is learning. Yes, it is good to know these things, rather than
not know them, if you really want the project to be a success. But
sometimes, if not often, it's difficult to separate the experience of
learning from the value that the learning gives you.

3. Contribution Safety

Leaders need to be able to contribute. From our point of view, as
managers of software development projects, they need to be able to
suggest things that they want the software to do. And they need to feel
comfortable doing so. This is tricky. Because of the swamp. The people
who live in the swamp, the people who own the swamp, the people who
might want to live in the swamp and the people who will never go to the
swamp, but still care about what happens there. All of these people need
to be taken care of to some degree. How also, to fit in the person who
is in charge of the project?

4. Critical Safety

Perhaps this is radically different for leaders than it is for team
members. Perhaps not. In this fourth level, where the leader is made to
feel as safe as possible by the team. So safe that the leader can admit
that they're wrong and can even be open to criticism from the team.
Maybe you're never going to get to this level. Maybe you're only going
to touch on it.

Unfortunately, what this shows us is that there is yet another side to
the trade-off of project management. And this is something that I think
I've got wrong, repeatedly, on several projects. What I think I've done,
is used the bad news on the project as a way of "levelling" me up with
he bosses. Of lowering the status of the bosses, of doing the opposite
of providing them with psychological safety. This is a really dumb move.

The challenge is to deal with the pirate ship on the horizon whilst at
the same time not rattling the psychological safety of your boss. It
means that the role of project manage isn't that of Jerry Springer --
you aren't just televising people's problems. You're making sure that
the bosses are aware of the problems. You're keeping those problems, in
the consciousness of your bosses. Using Daniel Kahneman's principle of
"What you see is all there is." You want to be creating artefacts and
having meetings where these problems are seen. Especially, if they are
problems that only your bosses can fix. What you're trying to do is to
engage the problem-solving mind of your bosses.

One of the things that makes this so difficult is that there is always
money is saying that everything is fine. A method like SAFE provides
psychological safety for your bosses, but it's an illusion of
psychological safety.

## Chapter 12 -- How to kill your boss

OK this is what I wanted to say and I'm just going to say it.

I think this book is described in an arc.

I think when I started this book, I was angry at bosses.

And this is something that I know intellectually is a stupid idea and a
bad idea and I need to get over it but that doesn't stop me feeling it.
I feel it viscerally.

How do I know it's a bad idea? Because of the doctor-patient
lawyer-client thing

Doctors see sick people. Lawyers, criminal lawyers especially, only see
people who have managed somehow to get themselves into trouble. Most
sick people and most people who have been charged with a crime have
probably got some opinions on what needs to be done. They think they
know what needs to be done to get them out of their predicament. But at
the same time, they've decided to consult a professional.

Maybe part of the reason that I have shied away from this in the past is
that I don't want to get too pretentious about the role of project
manager.

This isn't me saying that being a project manager is anywhere near
similar in terms of education and skills. This is me just pointing out
now there's a similarity in this dynamic between patient and doctor,
client and lawyer.

The people who come to you and ask you to manage their projects are in
trouble. Do they know that they're in trouble? That will probably vary
from case to case. And it's your job as a project manager to get them
out of trouble.

And do you know one of the ways that I got to this understanding? I
consulted a coach. Yes, I put myself in the same kind of relationship
with someone else and I talked through with her the problems that I have
had and the problems that I'm having. Out of these discussions, two key
ideas have emerged.

### Status

There is an in-built status relationship between a client and the
professional. The professional has to at least pretend that the client
is the boss.

This has often bothered me. I'm sure that there's some plain vanilla
psychological reason why people asserting their authority over me annoys
me so much, but it does. I mean, I think that it probably annoys a lot
of people, but I also see a lot of people that seem to be dealing with
it better than me.

And here's the mistake that I've made repeatedly. I've used bad news
as a way of trying to lower the status of the client. And let's just
think about this in doctor or lawyer terms. Do you think that that would
work? Of course, it doesn't work. It's a disaster. It makes the entire
discussion about the client reasserting their authority.

What's the solution? Never use how bad things are as a way of elevating
your status (really, this is attempt to lower the status of your boss).
It will depend on the boss and the circumstances, what status they will
tolerate from you. Some bosses very definitely want the people who work
for them to behave exactly like "people who work for them", all the
time. They never relax. Some bosses want the people who work for them to
be almost like equals. It will take some experimentation to know exactly
where the right point is with any given boss. Some bosses want one, but
pretend they want the other.

What's always going to be difficult if you're a project manager and
you're doing the job right is this. The "right" point for doing good
things for the project is different from the "safe" point. The "safe"
point is forlock-tugging and just doing as you're told. That's the
same as mopping the deck. It's agreed activity. It's the same safe
feeling, but it's actually dangerous behaviour.

## Timing

I'm in the timing business. Delivering things on time. That's what I
do. Right? Well. Right and wrong. Just because I'm in the timing
business doesn't mean that I can force my timings on the bosses. To
force my timings on the bosses will always be seen by them as an attempt
to lower their status.

And this is a tricky one. Let's say for example that some boss tells me
that they want something by a particular date. Christmas is the one that
comes up most often. Bosses always want things by Christmas. In my head,
the minute I hear this, I'm thinking of a bunch of things that need to
happen if there's a ghost of a chance of this happening by Christmas.
And a bunch of things are things that the boss needs to do. And the boss
has just said Christmas, so, if that's a real deadline, he needs to do
these things by a certain time. Right? Nu uh. No.

You would think it would be like that. It ought to be like that. It
isn't. It isn't and it never will be.

## Open questions

I don't think there is much in the literature to help with this. There
is mention in the writings of Robert Anton Wilson of something called
"the snafu principle."

"But a man with a gun is told only that which people assume will not
provoke him to pull the trigger."

This is the problem put most graphically, and most brutally.

And you might object that managing most projects doesn't involve any
actual violence. But I've said the wrong thing, or nearly the wrong
thing, to the "man with the gun" several times. And several times
it's resulted in me nearly being fired. Once it did get me fired. And
being unemployed, while not directly and automatically a violet
experience, can still be a tough one.

So how can we possibly deal with this? This is the fundamental problem.
This is the abyss right at the centre of project management.

We need to have honest conversations with our bosses. We don't ever
want to tell an armed man something that will make him fire his gun.

OK. Let me tell you some things that I know have worked. Then I'll tell
you some things that I *think* might work. Even though I haven't yet
exactly figured out how to apply them in what you'll see is a slightly
different context.

OK. What works?

Showing actual progress.

OK, here's the situation. I was working on a project. It was really
important that the project succeeded. There was probably more at stake
on this project than almost any other project that I've worked on.

When we started the project, I don't remember that it had a deadline.
Actually, that's not true, it did have a deadline, but it was a
deadline that was so ridiculous that nobody took it seriously. We were
going to have to build an entirely new system to manage a very
complicated licensing function for a government department. The initial
deadline (I mean how did anybody keep a straight face?) was seven
months. This was obviously impossible. But the contract with the current
supplier was running out and ideally, for the organisation, they would
have loved to stop at that point. But still, it was impossible. The fact
that it got mentioned at all tells you how powerful organisational
imperatives can be, even if they are completely at odds with reality.

Then the deadline suddenly became the old deadline plus 12 months. I
wasn't part of any discussion around this. And there was a solid
organisational reason for it. The old contract could be extended for 12
months in a relatively straightforward way. But after that, a new
contract would have to be negotiated with the old suppliers. And the
outgoing suppliers weren't happy that they hadn't won the new
contract. They were making expensive noises regarding keeping the old
system running beyond the 12 month extension.

So, it totally made sense for that to be the deadline.

There was just one problem. It was a big problem. To turn the old system
off, we needed to be able to turn the new system on. The new system
needed to be able to do enough of what the old system did to allow us to
do that. Which means the new system had to already be running and have
been tested with some users. This was a licensing system. The licences
were licences that granted to the owners' permission to do highly
controversial things. It needed to be very secure. We had to be
confident of this. But we also had to persuade security people inside
government of this.

When I heard about this new deadline, I realised that it was probably
very difficult to move. I thought of all the things that we'd have to
do before we got to the point where we could turn the new system on and
turn the old one off. But I also thought of something else. We couldn't
possibly do all the things that we had talked about doing before the
deadline. At that point, we didn't even have a basic working system for
doing the main thing - form submission - that the system was supposed to
do. Rather, we'd been concentrating on seeing the world through the
second metaphor that I've talked about above, "exploring the swamp."
We'd done lots of user research, we'd developed a good rapport with
most of our users. But we'd done almost nothing to limit the scope of
what we were going to do relative to what we'd found out that our users
wanted us to do.

As soon as I heard the deadline, I knew that we'd have to do three
things, and we'd have to do them relatively quickly.

1. We needed to put together a release plan. It needed to show the
dependencies between the security certifications and the testing we had
to carry out.

2. Come up with a strategy for limiting the scope of what we agreed to
deliver so that we had reasonable confidence that we could deliver it in
time.

3. At the same time, sooner rather than later, put together a piece of
skeleton working software that did the very least that the system was
supposed to do.

I was really worried. My rough guess was that we had probably 2-3 times
as much work that we'd identified, compared to what could be delivered
in the time. But that wasn't the worst thing. The worst thing was that
we didn't have a strategy for reducing scope. We didn't have any way
of stopping the mountain that we had to climb from simply getting bigger
and bigger..

### Understanding the status impact of bad news,asking open questions

Right at the start of this book, I talked about improvisational theatre.
My experience of improvisation classes is that whenever I do them, I
learn something. One thing I realised about this "sticking point" --
of delivering bad news to bosses is that I wasn't going to get around
it, over it or above it without some experimentation.

So, I decided to run some one-on-one improvisation sessions with actors
to try to really understand the ins and outs of the business of
delivering bad news.

These are the immediate impressions that I got from running several
sessions with an improvisation partner who I asked to play a boss. Let's
call him Dave.

1. Definite bad news is easier to deliver than hunches. This is a
problem, because identifying problems when they've just cropped up, on
the very edge of the radar, is probably the most valuable time.

2. It's an interesting question, how to find naturally high status
people that can take part in this kind of improvisation. Dave wasn't
naturally high status. This is just a sample of one, but he was
naturally low status (at the end of the call, he even said that it was
OK if I didn't pay him).

3. Getting people to say nasty things about other people is really,
really difficult (or I'm not doing it right). Also, when you've only
just met someone, they tend to be remarks about appearance,. I'm
wondering if the way around this is the Cyrano de Bergerac strategy i.e.
go through all the possible kinds of insult. And also, grade the
insults, also possibly just give the person that you're improvising with
a set of insults on cards.

E.g.

You're saying this because you're racist.

You're saying this because you're sexist (this one has happened to me
in real life).

You're just saying this because you're old and you don't have the
balls to take on a challenge anymore.

You're just saying this because you're young and inexperienced.

If you're not up to the job, just say, I'm sure I can find somebody
else who is.

If you're saying this, I'm wondering if you're competent.

That's exactly what someone who's trying to take all my money would
say.

Why are you always so negative?

You can't possibly know that.

I heard from somebody else that this was going fine.

How long have you known about this? Why didn't you tell me about this
before?

But if things are so bad, why aren't your team working longer hours to
fix this problem?

Your team don't seem to be working hard enough, they don't look
worried or stressed.

4. Asking open questions.

According to the Chris Voss author of *Never Split the Difference*, the
secret to negotiating with kidnappers is to ask them open questions. The
bosses in these kinds of situations are sort of like kidnappers.

I was doing this today. But I think there are important differences
between three different versions of the same questions.

a) What are you going to do?

b) What are we going to do?

c) What do you want us to do?

d) As a team we'd appreciate your advice on this matter.

5. Wanting to be smooth

This is a feeling that I had as we entered this final phase. That Dave -
my co-improviser, who was playing the boss, was trying to find any
"hold" that he could over me. And I wanted to be "smooth" to not
have any fault that he could catch hold of to gain the upper hand.

But as I'm writing this now, I'm wondering if this is quite stupid.
What are you trying to do from this kind of difficult conversation?

What you're trying to do, this is what you *should* be trying to do,
is to get the person that you're talking to, to think. We've already
figured out that telling senior people bad news is status lowering, so
they will naturally try to regain their status. This is tricky. Because
you need a certain level of status in order to continue to make them
think. But is that the same as the status you need for self-respect?

So do you need to resist this "wanting to be smooth" feeling? Do you
need to let your boss find some way to get a hold over you? I think you
do.

I'm wondering about the time that somebody suggested that a member of
my team was committing fraud. They thought he wasn't working full
hours, when in fact, he was turning up early and leaving early and this
had been agreed.

What possible responses were there to this accusation?

1. Anger. This is how I responded, pure, white, incandescent rage.
"How very fucking dare you? We agreed that Jerry was going to come in
early and leave early, you know that." Needless to say, this didn't go
down well.

2. Serious concern. Really? I'll check with Jerry, but I think he's
been coming in early. That's what we agreed. I'm very sorry that this
has come up as a concern and we definitely need to check.

3. Overkill and an attempt to gain the upper hand. "Really? Fraud,
that's a very serious allegation? Should we call the police? Oh? You
don't think we should call the police? Well, exactly how serious do you
think this is then?"

It took me a long time to realise that tit always has to be number 2.

The more psychological safety you can get in your team. The more successful it will be. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter COMMITMENT - Commitment and Consistency and Your Other Boss
========================================================================

We are driven to make sure that our actions consistent with what we say. We have a powerful urge to keep our promises and commitments. But if we don't understand what that really means when for project management, we'll probably break the project and make ourselves miserable in the process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds

>> Ralph Waldo Emerson

### Concept

In general, as human beings, we like to keep our promises. When we say
we're going to do something, we like to honour the commitment. Also wee
don't like our behaviour to look like it's all over the place. We want
to appear consistent. If we tell people that we're vegetarian, we
don't want to be caught eating a chicken burger the size of our head.

This is one of the most powerful principles that controls our behaviour
- it's known as commitment and consistency. We like to keep our
promises - commitment. We like to behave in a way that looks like it's
in line with what we believe - consistency.

This is, on the whole, a good thing. It's a good thing when people do
what they say they're going to do. It's a good thing when we behave in
a way that fits with what we say we believe. On the whole.

But project management isn't the whole. Project management is an
unusual activity, not like most of the rest of our life. And this is
especially true of project management when it comes to software
development? Why?

### Connections

Do you remember the swamp? That's why. Think about it just for a
second. What if I'm right about the swamp? What if I'm right that we
don't really know what we're going to find in there until we actually
go in there and start digging? And what about those people who care
about what happens in the swamp, that live nowhere near it? Didn't we
admit to ourselves in the last chapter that the only way to understand
what's going on in the swamp is to explore. Talk to people who might
want to live there. Talk to the people who already do live there. Start
to build up a picture (a map) of who the stakeholders are and how they
relate to each other.

Didn't we also admit that the only way to understand what we can do in
the swamp, and what might be of any value, is to actually do stuff?

Translated back into non-swamp language, what does this mean for
software development? It means that we need to do user and stakeholder
research and we need to deliver working software. We won't really know
what's possible, valuable, legal and attractive (i.e. what has value)
in a new area until we've done that kind of exploration.

But guess what? Guess when as a team, as a project, we're often asked
to say what our software is going to do? Guess when we're asked, how
long it's going to take? When are we expected to even know how much it
will cost? And what value it will deliver? Not after we've done all
that exploration of the swamp, but before we've even started.

### Concrete Practice

I think I had just been reading Robert Cialdini's book *Influence: The
Psychology of Persuasion*. That was where the problem started. I hadn't
been working for this company long. It was a small company with fewer
than a dozen people working on that many projects. I'd been brought in
as their Scrum Master. We were having a meeting on the phone, almost at
the start of a new project. We'd discussed some of the things that
needed doing to move the project further forward.

It wasn't the kind of meeting that I liked. It wasn't an Agile
meeting. There wasn't just one kind of thing that we were talking
about. It was more free-form and rambling than that. But it was with the
chairman of the company, and this project was his baby, so I didn't
feel I could interrupt too much. The meeting ran long (as meetings that
don't have a single specified purpose and aren't time-boxed and
aren't facilitated by someone who cares about these things are wont to
do). But then, just when I was hoping that the meeting was going to be
over, just when the chairman gave me hope by saying "Right then!", he
snatched that hope away.

Instead of stopping the meeting, he said, "Let's go round the table
and I want you to promise the team that the actions that you've been
given will be done in time for the next meeting."

What? Promise? I could hear the other members of the team around the
virtual, conference phone table solemnly committing to do their actions.
These had been captured during the meeting and written down with team
members' names against them. What was I going to do when he got around
to me?

I knew that the actions that had my name against them were vague. I knew
that I could probably have some story to tell that they were done by the
next time we had a meeting. At the same time, I knew something else. I
knew that some members of the team were committing to things they had no
business committing to. Either they had no chance of doing them by the
next time we met, or they simply had no idea whether they could do them
or not. They weren't committing because they thought they could do the
tasks. There were committing because they wanted to avoid the difficult
situation they would be in if they refused to commit.

Also, in the back of my mind, were some things I'd been hearing about
how this guy, Mr Chairman, was working with the rest of the team. He
himself worked from home most of the time and got up at 4 am. I had
vaguely heard some worrying discussions in the stand-up meeting. He'd
been getting some of the other, younger members of the team to have
meetings at 5 am. He had also been encouraging people to work through
the night to meet his deadlines.

You know what? Fuck that.

So, when my turn came, I said, "I'm sorry, I can't commit to doing my
actions from this meeting. I'll do my best obviously. But some of those
things, they're just too uncertain."

And. Oh my god! Mr Chairman put the phone down! I really wonder what
would have happened if it had been a face-to-face meeting.

Now I'm wondering if I should have told this story. Because I'm not
exactly sure what the moral of it is. I think a bunch of things were
going on at the same time to make this go so badly. We'd only just
started working together. The chairman wasn't to know that pushing to
people to make undeliverable commitments was a hot button issue for me.

Getting people to make commitments that they couldn't possibly honour
was clearly a management approach that had worked for the chairman
before. Really, in the Tuckman level stages of "forming, storming,
norming and performing" we were definitely in the storming phase.

I suppose the real take away from this is that for many people who are
used to "getting things done." Getting people to make commitments that
they are in no position to make is pretty much the beginning and end of
their management strategy.

Actually, since then, I've come to realise that things are actually
worse than that. To give the chairman his due. At least he was trying to
get us to hang ourselves with our own words. In many other situations
that I've been in since, the boss tries to use the power of commitment
and consistency *even when no commitment has been made*!

Sometimes this takes the shape of what I find myself calling "commitment
and consistency Jujitsu."

Normally this is something like "You committed to A, and I took a to
mean, B, C, D and P, Q, R -- oh and also X, Y and Z."

Sometimes it's just flat out brute force rank-pulling "I've committed to
this, so you've committed to it."

I used to think that if I were going to write a book about how to
successfully deliver software development projects, I would have to have
some kind of fiendishly clever way of diffusing these claims that a
commitment has been made. That this would the point where I tell you how
to avoid being on the hook for a ridiculous commitment.

Here's what I know. I don't know how to do that. Rather what I've
realised is, that, like death and taxes. Stupid deadlines are always
going to be with us.

### Conclusion

When I run Agile training courses, I do an exercise at the start of the
very first day, just to get people out of their seats, standing up and
talking to each other.

I ask the group to split themselves into smaller groups. I then give
each group a pad of flip chart paper and some pens and ask them to draw
a "stick person" in the middle of the piece of paper. Then I ask them
to give that person a smiley face. Then I ask them to write down as many
words and phrases as they can which they associate with a "happy"
project - with a project that is going well.

Almost always, the first thing that gets written down is "On time, to
budget." Do you know what almost never gets written down? I might have
seen it twice in ten years of running training courses. "Valuable to
its customers." Do you know what gets written down even less often? I
think I've seen it once in those 10 years. "Makes money."

Maybe this is because I'm asking the wrong question. Maybe if I talked
about a happy product rather than a happy project, I would get better
answers. But this simple exercise shows something project managers
already know. People think that project management is almost entirely
about keeping promises. They think it's about being on time and keeping
to budget. They forget what's actually important. Whatever the project
is producing needs to be valuable to somebody. Sometimes that value
isn't cash. Often that value isn't just cash. Of course, in a lot of
cases, it would be good if the project made money. And if it did, it
wouldn't matter, or certainly wouldn't matter so much, if it were late
and over budget.

For me, commitment and consistency is the electric cattle prod of
project management. People who don't have experience of delivering
projects often think that keeping promises is the most important thing,
if not the only thing. They forget about "valuable to customers", they
forget about "makes money." But they also seem to think that it's the
best and most powerful way of making the people involved in a project do
their bidding. They are certainly right that "commitment and
consistency" has power.

It's so powerful that it still has power, even when it's been used
against people who never made a commitment. It's still powerful even in
situations that aren't consistent. This is what I call "commitment and
consistency Jujitsu."

For example, I was recently in a discussion about a new feature for an
existing, successful, product. The owner of the product - the guy who
paid the bills - wanted this new feature. He hadn't mentioned it
before. But now he was saying that it was really important and that
he'd promised it to clients at a meeting.

The logic of what he was saying was this: "I've promised this - so you
have to deliver it." But of course, this is, totally bogus. Just
because somebody else has promised something, doesn't mean I'm on the
hook for delivering it. Then again, this guy is my customer, he pays the
bills, he's my boss, I want to help him if I can. And the force of this
argument is "I've promised this, if I don't deliver it, I will appear
to be untrustworthy, don't do that to your boss."

And unfortunately, as a project manager, I have another boss. Reality.

We don't know what this new feature really is. Because we don't know
what it is, we don't know what it involves. Maybe we can deliver it in
that time. Maybe we can't. We're certainly not in a position to
promise anything.

What is happening here is that my boss is trying to use commitment and
consistency jujitsu to get some extra software done. This software is a
change to what we've already planned. But that's fine. When we're
using Agile, iterative methods, we accept change, even late in the day.

But this is a "I promised this, so you promised this, so it has to
happen" argument. It's also trying to avoid something. Let's say that
we have "promised" this thing that we only just found out about.
We're going to have to *not* do something else. And it's very
possible that the other thing, the thing we're not going to do, has
also been promised.

Actually, I'm very careful not to promise things unless I really have
to. So more likely, it's been discussed, it's been seen on plans. What
we will have said will be something like "this will be the next thing
that we do, unless priorities change." But rest assured, what somebody
will have heard is "we promise to deliver this by a certain date."

What this boss is really trying to do is talk himself into a situation
where he can have his cake and eat it.

Fortunately, the boss in this case is a reasonable person. He
acknowledges that we can't do both of these things at the same time.

But lots of bosses aren't that reasonable. Lots of bosses would try to
avoid making this connection.

The poem that keeps coming into my head when I'm thinking about
deadlines and commitment and consistency is "The Hound of Heaven." Which
is about the poet trying to avoid the inevitability of his own death. As
we've just discussed, death is inevitable, I think I've realised that
bosses playing silly buggers with deadlines is also inevitable. But do
you know what's also inevitable?

### Criticism

>> Well, none of this would be a problem if you did what you said you
were going to do.

Yeah. OK. Actually no, this is not OK.

Here's why. What I was always going to have to do was explore the
swamp. In order get funding to do the project, despite all of my best
efforts, I might have been manoeuvred into saying something that sounded
like a promise.

When me and my team started exploring the swamp, we found stuff that we
could never have imagined would be a problem. Or maybe, when we started
exploring the swamp, we found stuff that the customer already knew was a
problem. They knew it was a problem, but they kept quiet about until
after we'd made our commitment.

So, I don't agree with this statement. By agreeing to do this project,
we agreed to encounter problems. We might not have said that out loud.
But we did. By agreeing to this project, we agreed to the possibility
that we wouldn't be able to do what we said we were going to do because
of those problems.

### Confessions

It still hurts. I can tell myself all I want that being attacked by some
senior manager for not "delivering what was promised" shouldn't
affect me. But it does.

I felt the sting of this kind of attack only recently. We'd been asked
to do a follow-up piece of research to a feasibility study. In the
proposal that we'd put forward, we'd suggested that we'd be able to
get some working software together within two months. Note to self. No
matter how short the engagement, always deliver *some* working
software.

The initial feasibility study, which our bid was based on, wasn't quite
as described. It was supposed to be a survey of possible users across
the industry. In fact, it was mainly a survey of, well, possible users
inside the survey company. Note to self. If you're promising work on
the back of something that's already been done, make sure that you
caveat your work. Say it will only be done if the other piece of work is
as described.

Even though the boss admitted that there were problems with the initial
study, he repeatedly brought up our original commitment. He repeatedly
used what he portrayed as our broken promise to get more free work out
of us. And even though I knew what he was saying was complete rubbish,
it still hurt.

I would dearly like to avoid this "commitment and consistency" dance.
I would dearly like for it not to hurt when people accuse me of breaking
my promises. I would like people to stop using contorted logic to
supposedly show that me and my team have broken our promises.

But I've realised that it can't be avoided. Most projects simply
won't get off the ground and won't be approved unless some kind of
promise is extracted from the people who are going to deliver.

## Chapter CONVERSATION - The Conversation
============================================

There is no point shouting at our clients, there is no point shouting at the team. Similarly, there's no point keeping quiet when we see that things are going wrong and if our clients avoid us, it's pretty much game over. Successful project management is about continually, actively working to keep the conversation going.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> The only successful way of rendering this disturbance inoperative
is to keep on breathing quietly and unconcernedly, to enter into
friendly relations with whatever appears on the scene, to accustom
oneself to it, to look at it equably and at last grow weary of looking.

Eugen Herrigel - Zen in the Art of Archery

Project management is all about improving the quality of the
conversation. That's the idea that I want you to passionately believe
by the end of this chapter.

This is the realisation that I've come to. I've had hints of it in the
past, but writing this book, working to communicate what I know about
project management, has made me much more certain.

We're all probably agreed in theory that communication is a good thing.
But we're also probably agreed that not all communication is of the
same quality. There's a Monty Python sketch that involves performing
the novel Wuthering Heights using semaphore flags. What that graphically
shows is that some communication, for some things, is probably better
suited than others. There are good and bad kinds of communication. But
for project management, what *kind* of communication is a good thing?
What characterises it and how can we make sure that that's the kind
that we use in our projects?

And there's another, related question. If there is a kind of
conversation that's a good kind, why is there so much bad
communication?

What kind of conversation is good communication? The ideas that I'm
going to talk about mainly in this chapter are based on the work of
Patsy Rodenburg and her book *Presence*.

Rodenburg's idea is that there are three basic kinds of communication.
She calls these first, second and third circle.

The first circle is going inwards, it's introspective. First circle is
either not talking or talking to yourself. If first circle is talk at
all, it's probably mumbling. It's either talking quietly, or using a
language that only really makes sense to the person who is talking.
First circle is quiet, timid. Someone who is in first circle might look
like they're listening. But in some fundamental way, they aren't. They
aren't engaging with what's been said.

The opposite of first circle is third circle. Third circle is extrovert.
It's shouting and pushing. It's presenting and performing to others.
It is telling people things that you want them to hear. It is showing
people things you want them to see. Third circle is loud, it is
flamboyant and possibly aggressive, possibly aggressively friendly. It
doesn't want to hear what other people have to say. In fact, as we'll
see, that's a large part of the reason for third circle.

The second circle is genuine dialogue. Each side is paying attention.
They are being changed by what the other side says. Each side is coming
to an understanding of the other's position. That doesn't mean that
everyone in second circle accepts that the other side's position is
right or true. But if two sides are in second circle, they at least
accept that the other side has a position.

From the point of view of project management, by engaging in second
circle, you can start to understand what's valuable to your client.
When you do that, you can see if there are things that you can offer,
even if these things aren't valuable to you. This is closely related to
the discussion about the swamp that we had earlier.

By revealing the current situation through discussion, you can manage to
make something magical and alchemical happen. You can get your
"opponents" to negotiate, not with you, but with themselves. Again,
this is closely related to something that we've already talked about -
the pirate ship. There is bad news on the horizon. It needs dealing
with. The crew by themselves can't deal with it. They need insight,
strategy and decisive action from whoever is in charge.

Whatever the problem is, it is very dangerous to ignore it. And,
although everybody might feel better for a while, it's also dangerous
and ineffective to rail against it, and just complain that the world
shouldn't be like this.

So, here's my thesis about what project management is about: it's
about working to improve the quality of second circle conversation.

Understanding and accepting this can be good news if you're a project
manager. Because if you accept this, your job description changes. Your
job is no longer about delivering the impossible. It's about improving
the conversation between the people who are asking for something
that's, on the face of it, impossible and the people who are trying to
deliver it. Of course, there's a secondary goal of trying to improve
the communication enough so that what's being asked for starts to be
something that's possible. Because possible things are deliverable, and
so actually capable of delivering value in the real world. But since the
only way to do that is to keep improving - and maintaining second circle
conversation, that really isn't the *main* concern.

My conclusion is that if you focus on the quality of the conversation,
you can be comfortable working on seemingly impossible projects. Why?
Because what you are doing when you're working on these projects is
focusing on keeping the conversations in second circle.

Projects will only work if there's genuine dialogue between the team
and the client. Now obviously, all the practices that we've talked
about in this book are still important. It's important to understand
the swamp. Who owns this area? Who's interested in this area? Who lives
in it? Who works in it? Who regulates it? What unexpected value have you
unearthed through exploration?

It's important to work in a way that encourages transparency,
inspection and adaptation. It's important to call out the problems, the
pirate ships, which are visible on the horizon. These things are vital
to improving the quality of the conversation.

In every organisation, and maybe every project, the nature of this
conversation will be different. You will need to start from the
beginning. Sometimes things will be familiar enough from other projects
that you can start to pick up speed. Sometimes everything will be
strange and different. Sometimes, it will seem like nobody will want to
talk to you.

But in every new project and in every new organisation, there will
always be work that needs to be done. There will always be effort to
figure out how and when it's best to have dialogue, second circle
conversation.

So, if the solution is second circle conversations, why don't people
just stay in those kinds of conversations the whole time? If that
happened, wouldn't so many projects be so much more successful?

The reason people don't stay in second circle the whole time is that it
can be dangerous and exhausting.

Why is it dangerous? Because being in second circle is revealing and the
more people know about you, the more likely it is that they can use what
they know to harm you. Even if people don't intend you harm. Second
circle is revealing. It's revealing of your real values, your real
motivators your real strengths and weaknesses. Instinctively we avoid
being this revealing.

Why is it exhausting? Because, when you're in a genuine give and take
dialogue, you have to think. You can do first circle in several
different ways. You can simply be quiet and not listen to what others
are saying to you. You can listen to what others say, but not engage
with it. You can even just accept whatever others say and cease to have
any opinions yourself. None of these options involve anywhere near as
much effort as trying to remain in second circle and engaging.

Engaging means asking questions, not only of the people that you're
talking to, but of yourself. Questions like, am I right? Am I seeing
this straight? Are my intuitions valid in this situation? What can we do
about these issues that seem to make this project impossible? What can
we do with the contradictory behaviour from the client? How can we deal
with their insistence that progress on the project needs to be faster
whilst at the same time they are refusing to help us remove the "bricks
without straw" problems?

OK, let's say you're with me to this point. So, what are the concrete
actions that we can take to make sure that we're talking reasonably in
second circle with our clients and not yelling or mumbling?

First of all, it's important to understand that all of the Agile
ceremonies create opportunities for second circle conversations. Notice
that I say that they create opportunities. They don't guarantee it. In
the chapter where I talk about "Fried egg Agile" I would say that most
of the ways that I've modified the way that I do Agile are connected
with improving the conversation, or creating artefacts that can be used
to improve the conversation.

It's a very good way of seeing the Agile meetings - as opportunities
for conversation. Blockers that come up in stand up? Opportunities for
conversation.

Questions from the product owner as to why the team haven't planned as
much as they had imagined? An opportunity for conversation.

Surprise, shock or horror at a demonstration of working software? This
is certainly an opportunity for conversation.

A recurring theme in retrospectives about some infrastructural, "bricks
without straw problem?" This is also a chance to have that talk.

Count things and then use the numbers as conversation pieces.

Count things? Count things like what? Here are some things that have
worked for me in the past.

How long does it take for a piece of work to get from the point where
it's agreed that it should be worked on, to the point where it is in
the software?

How much work is the team completing on average in a two-week period?
When does that mean the project is likely to complete all the work
that's needed?

How long does a piece of work, on average, have to wait for an expert
opinion before it can be worked on? How long is the list of things that
are currently waiting?

What's the rate at which the budget is being spent?

All these numbers are the kind of numbers that a Lean approach to
manufacturing and development suggest you count.

Of course, carrying out user research at any stage in the project is
actively having second circle conversations with people who might use
the software. And then reporting research findings about current users,
possible users and other interested parties to the client is another
crucial set of second circle conversations.

Discussing these things in second circle will probably increase the
chances of a project being successful. I'm putting this mildly. It will
dramatically increase the chances of the project being successful. In
fact, it's probably the only chance.

Discussing these things also brings with it the chance of a first circle
response from the client (ignoring you) or a third circle response
(shouting at you). And that in turn, I'm ashamed to admit it, leads to
similar kinds of reactions from you as a project manager, or your whole
team.

I've reacted many times to first circle reactions from the client with
third circle responses, asking awkward, angry questions in meetings,
putting the pirate ship issue that the client doesn't want to hear in
reports with a wider audience.

I've also lost my temper when either me, or my team have been addressed
in shouty third circle. Many times. And I don't feel guilty about these
reactions. I feel shame. A more powerful emotion. Guilt is about what
you've done. Shame is about who you are. And when I think about these
things, in the past, I've felt shame at who I am. I'm the kind of
childish, uncontrolled individual who reacts emotionally to attacks.

But two things have started to make me feel better about the responses
I've made in the past. Seeing these things through the lens of first
and third circle helps a lot. It has helped me to progress to a feeling
of, not shame, not even guilt, just a kind of old fighter's
acknowledgement of those times when my opponent made a move that I in my
naivete couldn't counter.

The second thing that has helped, is to realise that when I've reacted
with anger (third circle) or silence (first circle) to some kind of
response from the client, I'm doing what they want me to do. I'm
responding in a way that is fine with them. Almost always, in these
situations, the way that they want me, and my team to respond is by
shutting up and not bothering them with the problems that they need to
give some attention. Sometimes they want us to respond by faking an
"agreed activity" of running around and looking busy and getting
visibly stressed i.e. "working hard."

Because you're the supplier and they're the client, because they're
senior and you're junior, they don't expect you to get angry. At
least, they don't expect you to show that you're angry. But it's
really no skin off their nose if you do.

Here's the kind of dialogue that can happen.

PM: We can't really make any more progress on the payment function
until we get details of the transaction database. [ Second circle ]

Client: I'll put you in touch with Jeff.

PM: Jeff won't talk to us. He's ignoring our emails and our calls.

Client: I'm just tired of your excuses and your negativity. I thought
I'd hired a team who could get things done. Maybe I need to get that
team over there from X Corp to look at this, they'll probably be happy
to take over the work.

This is third circle. It's angry and shouting. And the purpose of it
isn't to solve the problem, it's to stop you talking about the
problem.

The mistake that I've made in the past with this kind of response is to
deal with the content.

PM: I think if you asked X Corp, they would say the same thing.

Also, I would get angry. I would get angry at the threat to take the
work away, and I would get angry at the suggestion that me and my team
are either being dishonest or don't know what we're talking about.

Now, I think I would try to keep the conversation in second circle. I
would do my best not to get angry.

PM: We can't see how we're going to solve this problem without access
to that database. I think if we could just talk to somebody from the
team that is building the transaction database, we can get a better idea
of when it's likely to be ready. And if that's going to be a long
time, we can maybe start to talk about what we can do without it.

I don't expect the client to behave well or rationally in response to
this. I don't think it's impossible that the client will go and talk
to X corp. If you were the project manager are you scared now that they
might go and talk to X Corp? Is it going to shut you up? Because that
last thing the client wants to do is to go through all the rigmarole of
changing suppliers, but what they do want you to do is shut you up so
they don't have to think. Of course, losing the project to another
supplier is really scary. It's perhaps made a little bit better
imagining that this isn't just one conversation. You can back off and
come back another day.

Here's where I'm going make an admission. And it's quite a big one. I
don't think I'm that good at second circle communication. Second
circle communication, especially between me and clients - actually,
it's with everyone - is something that I continuously struggle with.
The thing I'm probably best at is spotting the pirate ships on the
horizon and insisting that they get talked about, rather than ignored.

There are always going to be people who are better at having difficult,
second circle, conversations than me.

Maybe you are a natural at having these kinds of conversations (the
evidence that we see from most projects is that most people aren't).
Maybe you work with people who are better at having those kinds of
conversations than you are. Maybe you all find it hard, and you need to
work together to make sure that these conversations happen. Even so, if
you understand and accept that this is what you have to do, you can
agree to inspect and adapt as a team to get better at these kinds of
conversations.

Because this is an important thing to understand. As a team you need to
be having second circle conversations with your client. Not just once,
but repeatedly throughout the project, all the time through the project.

You also need to be clear that, for those of you who do this
communication, it might be very difficult. The responses that you get
from the client may well be third circle. What are some third circle
responses that you might get from the client?

They might shout at you to go faster. They might complain that your team
isn't looking ill enough and stressed enough. They might point out
(whether it's true or not) that you promised to do a certain thing, by
a certain time and you haven't. They will cast doubt on your ability
and your professionalism. They will often accuse you of lying and
deception. A lot of what's said in these situations isn't about
solving any of the problems on the project. It's about making you shut
up.

These are all third circle responses. And to a degree they may work. The
fact is that they don't really mean the things that they're saying -
much. What they're really doing is just saying anything to shut you up.
And, if you can stop yourself in time, this might be something to bear
in mind when you find yourself reacting emotionally to what they say.
You may find yourself angry at the idea that your clients want to
physically and psychologically harm you and your team. You might feel
anger and shame at the suggestion that you haven't kept your promises.
You might get a sinking feeling in your stomach that your name will be
mentioned in connection to your bosses in connection with losing work to
a competitor.

And it's important to have those emotions, because if you don't, they
will "have" you. They will highjack you. They will stop you from
thinking clearly and they will prevent you (or your team) from talking
to your client in second circle. And guess what? That's what accusing
you and your team of being incompetent, dishonest or lazy is designed to
do. This might not be conscious on the part of the client, but it's
exactly what's going on. Most people when they are attacked like this
will either shut up (first circle) or be stung into a bout of frenzied
agreed activity. Looked at in this way, agreed activity is a kind of
manic, performative first circle.

In the worst, career-threatening cases, you might answer third circle
attacks with a third circle response.

I've been stupid enough to argue back in third circle in the past. It
doesn't work. It doesn't do anybody any good. It doesn't do you any
good, as a project manager. It doesn't do your client any good. It's
just another form of having the wrong conversation. It doesn't do the
project any good.

How to deal with show trials and loyalty declarations?

I'd been working on the project about two months. We were supposed to
be going live at Easter. The obsession of clients to launch software to
coincide with Christian festivals made a bit more sense this time. It
was a product that was used by university students. It made sense to
deliver when they were taking a vacation. My boss had promised a certain
list of functions would be delivered before Easter.

And the result of that promise was that he wanted everyone working on
the project (and that was around 70 people) to tell him on a scale of
one to five how sure they were that we would deliver for Easter.

To start with, he picked his favourites. The people that he knew would
be most likely to say "Five." And sure enough, by the time he got
around to people who were more independent minded and knew the state of
the project, there was an immense and building pressure for everyone to
say "Five." Every time a team member said "five" he would beam.
Occasionally a brave soul would say "four" and this would bring about
a period of gruff interrogation. Sometimes this even resulted in the
poor soul sinking completely into submission and changing their score to
"five." Even if that didn't happen, it would pretty much ensure the
next few team members got the message and would cheerfully trot out
"five." Then it was my turn. "Two."

My boss's face clouded. "Why two?"

"As you know, we've put the things that we said we'd deliver into
three groups. We've got the things that we've guaranteed. Then we've
got the things that we've said we have a reasonable chance of
delivering. And we've also got things that we've said we'll deliver
only if we have time. Current progress suggests that we won't quite
make all of the things that we've guaranteed. And I think a lot of the
board think they're going to get all of the things that we've
mentioned. In fact, I've heard some of them say that."

When the "meeting" was over, I had the inevitable one-on-one with my
boss.

"Why did you embarrass me in front of the whole team?"

"Because they weren't going to tell you the truth, and it was unfair
to ask them to."

"Never embarrass me in front of the team like that."

"OK, if you don't ask such a question like that in front of the team
there's a good chance I won't."

Could I have handled it better? I'd be astounded if there weren't at
least a dozen better ways. But I'm still not exactly sure what they
would be.

I think I should have probably said "four" in front of the team. Then
I should have asked for the one to one.

I should have walked through all the things that I was "assuming"
would be fine that had allowed me to talk about a four. But I should
have also tried to understand what the background and motivations were
for him doing what he'd done. Making everyone say out loud that they
were certain, or almost certain, that the project could be delivered on
time was, of course, aggressive third circle communication.

Encouraging public declarations like this are calculated to avoid any
kind of dissent or discussion. And they're always a sign of
desperation.

So, this pulls us back to the guru of Toyota, Taiichi Ohno's, question -
what business are you in? Yes, you're in the business of keeping the
channels of communication open. You're in the business of providing
opportunities for second circle conversations. But you're also in the
business of finding new ways to keep second circle communication with
the client going. But how exactly do you do that? The Agile meetings are
part of that. And this is also the reason that the success of a project
is directly related to the quality of the relationship that the product
owner has with the client. Running the Agile meetings, counting things
and showing progress are part of this.

Another good tactic is a dedicated risks and issues meeting.

This is a tactic that's worked very well for me recently. We were
working on a project in a big organisation. The product owner told me
that we needed to submit a risks and issues log to a programme-level
governance function. I was sceptical. I hadn't had a lot of luck with
risks and issues logs. In my previous experience they had been
"information refrigerators." That is documents that got produced because
someone or something (like a programme-level governance function) has
asked for. But once they had been produced. That was it, they didn't get
reviewed or upddated.

Now it occurs to me, that as a project manager I should in general be a
lot less sceptical about suggestions for anything that changes what
people see - because what you see is all there is.

What I see now is that if you're going to create any artefact that is
intended to be used as part of the process of managing your project, you
need to also have some kind of process for maintaining it.

With risks and issues, it's the process for maintaining it that's far
more useful than the document itself.

Ignoring my doubts (quite rightly) the product owner came back with a
suggestion from one of the big names in Agile - Mike Cohn. The
suggestion was for a Kanban-style board showing all the risks but then,
providing each risk with a score. How did we calculate the risk score?
Very roughly. The score was the cost of fixing a risk if it became a
genuine issue. This was in terms of days for the whole team. So, for
example, if the risk was "We can't find a rich text editor plug-in
that meets our needs", the cost of that might be three months of work
for the whole team - 60 days. And the likelihood of this might be low -
20 percent. Then the total score for that risk would be 20 times 60 -
1200. Scoring things with this slightly (almost totally) fantastical
score meant that we could do several important things.

Firstly, and most importantly, we could have a fortnightly meeting where
we discussed each of the risks - starting with the column which had the
risks which scored the most. Then we could discuss if the score on the
risk had changed. This was by far the most important aspect of having
the risks board. Changes in score tended to indicate changes in
understanding of the project or, more importantly for me, changes in
political circumstances within the organisation. Talking about risk
scores turned out to be a very good way of getting into a second circle
conversation, a useful conversation, with the client about what is going
on in the organisation.

One of the risks that we had on that project, that we talked about every
two weeks, was "The project isn't delivered on time." Another was
"We don't get funding to continue." Risks were also a way of safely
containing rhetorical attacks on the team and general vague worries.
Some examples of these: "The project causes reputational damage to the
department." and "The department loses confidence in the development
team." Discussing these risks every fortnight gave the client an
opportunity to let off steam. But tracking these risks, and scoring
them, allowed for a secondary benefit.

We could plot the overall risk score over time. We could see when the
risks were sky high, which at one point they were - not having the money
to continue is a big risk. At one point there was a high chance of not
delivering and a high chance of not getting the money to deliver. But
over time, the risks reduced.

Setting up a risks and issues board and discussion is one quite straight
forward way of encouraging third circle discussion.

Something that, isn't really a tactic, but is more of a consideration,
is to think about, what I call, the words and music. Something that
occurs to me when thinking about these instances of third circle
barrages is that the main mistake is to engage directly with the
content, rather than the fact that it's a third circle barrage. Nothing
useful can be done until we've acknowledged that it was a third-circle
attack. As we've mentiond before, once you've noticed that it's a
third circle attack, your next move shouldn't be to engage with the
content of the third circle attack, it should be to look for some way to
have a second circle conversation.

And, in general, that should be the approach that you're taking the
whole way through a project. You need to be looking for the places where
there are "conversations" happening in first circle. These, of course,
might be conversations that aren't happening at all. This is the agreed
activity of scrubbing the deck while the pirate ship is on the horizon.
But they also might be conversations that are happening very quietly.
It's quite surprising how someone can get away with mumbling
essentially the same update in stand-up. It can happen for days,
sometimes weeks.

At the same time, it's important to be looking for situations which are
in the third circle or are turning into third circle. Again, this can
happen in stand up. The client can decide that the stand up is the
meeting which he needs to use to take the opportunity to shout at the
team and tell them to go faster. The client can decide that he wants to
use show and tell to talk about how great the software *will* be
rather than show how it currently is.

The client can bring his boss, or his boss's boss, or the chairman of
the company to the stand up.

And it can happen with planning. For years, I've known what a good
planning meeting sounds like and I've struggled to express it. Finally,
by thinking about second circle, I think I've got a way of expressing
it. A good planning meeting is absolutely about entering into second
circle. The product owner walks through what they'd like to get done in
the next two weeks.

Then the team ask questions. Sometimes they suggest that something is
too small and it can be bundled in with something else. Sometimes they
point out that something is huge and will either take several sprints or
will need to be broken down into smaller bits. Sometimes there's heated
discussion which ranges quite widely before it settles on an agreed
understanding. That's a second circle planning.

But, as with all the other opportunities for second circle discussion,
it can go wrong in lots of ways. The product owner can think that
planning is about telling the team what they are going to do. It can
even go wrong the other way. The team can start telling the product
owner what they're going to do, ignoring the product owner's own
priorities for the backlog.

But by far the most common way that planning slips out of second circle
is that it becomes a discussion between the product owner and the lead
developer. They might be in second circle with each other. Of course,
that's better than the product owner lecturing the developer, or the
other way round. But the rest of the team are saying nothing. This is
still bad; involving other developers and team members in second circle
discussion is just as important as involving the client in second circle
discussion.

So, to come back again to the Taiichi Ohno question. If you're a
project manager and you're tasked with delivering the impossible, what
business are you in?

This is the business that you're in. You're in the business of
encouraging and initiating second circle discussions. Your in the
business of the places where people involved with the project are
mumbling or shouting and figuring out, with the help of the team, how to
make those discussions more useful. What you want is second circle
discussion. No shouting, no mumbling. Actual valuable exchange of
information.. And to get it you'll need to have a box of tricks.

The agile meetings are part of the box of tricks. Support for user
research and the actual conduct of user research is another part of the
box of tricks. Various kinds of artefacts that *show* the progress of
the project rather than *tell* the client about the project are also
part of that box of tricks. Risk meetings, where all kinds of changes in
the organisational structure, changes in understanding about the project
and subtle shifts in focus and value come out during conversation, are
also in the box, but so is developing the skill of listening to not only
the words of a rant from someone senior, but also the music.

## Chapter EMOTION --We don't have our emotions they will have us
===================================================================

Why don't we want to tackle the pirate ship? Why don't we retreat into silence or brashly state our opinion? Why do accusations of not delivering on commitments hurt so much? What could the reason possibly be, but our instinctive desire to avoid negative emotions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me be completely open with you. I've been getting coaching. Full-on
Agile coaching of the don't say much and let the client work it out for
themselves kind.

I don't know how many sessions we've had, but it's more than ten. At
the very end of my last session, she asked me if she could "share"
something with me. That's Agile coach speak for mentioning that she has
an opinion.

And the thing she wanted to share with me was this. I'd started the
coaching sessions with a problem. I still have that problem. What was
the problem? The problem was and still is that I find it difficult to
talk to senior, "C-Level" people.

The observation that she was making was that I had a lot of skills in
project management, I had a lot of experience of project management. I
clearly don't have any problem talking to her. I don't seem to have
any problem talking with my team. So why do I have so much difficulty
talking to "C-Level" people?

And my answer, maybe it was too frank was that when I'm talking to her,
and most of the time when I'm talking to members of my team, I'm not
angry. And almost all of the time when I'm talking to C-Level people
who are involved in the projects that I'm working on, I am angry. What
am I angry about?

I think one thing that I'm annoyed about is that they don't want to
listen to me. They are not doing the things that they need to do in
order to make a project a success. When a boss says that he or she wants
a project to succeed, but then does a number of things that will almost
guarantee that a project won't succeed, are they lying?

And mixed in with the anger is shame. I'm ashamed that I'm angry.

And now, writing this, mixed in with *that* is fear. Fear that there
isn't any way to fix this, that this is always how I'm going to be in
these situations. That there is no cure.

What I want to be like is like Columbo. Mild mannered, polite, but
gently pushing the matter towards its inevitable conclusion.

### Bullshit

You have to tell them something. And it has to be something shiny. But
those are the things that you have to care about most. You don't have
to worry so much about it being true. In fact, you don't have to worry
at all about it being true. Bullshit isn't designed to play in the
world. Bullshit is design to play in the truncated, limited resolution,
limited imagination, model of the world that sits in people's heads.

### Fuck it

What are the risks? What are the potential benefits? We need to weigh
these carefully and then decide on a course of action. Don't we? Do we?
Is this really how we decide how to behave?

What if it isn't?

What if our main guide for how to behave is not some careful reasoning
from the facts, what if our main guide for behaviour is to behave how
everyone else does?? But then periodically, we have a crazy dream, or we
realize that the only way out of the particular situation is to offer
someone else a crazy dream.

Nothing happens unless at some point, someone shrugs their shoulders and
says "Fuck it."

### Bounded Rationality

I think this concept is best explained by the genius Spike Milligan in a
episode of the Goon Show.

Bloodknock: You Chinese think of everything

Grippipe Thin: But I'm not Chinese!

Bloodknock: Then you've forgotten something?

Milligan in his unique way is making a joke about the fact that nobody
can think of everything. The reason that every now and then someone can
get away with shrugging their shoulders and taking a risk that isn't
calculated is that we have to engage in something called something
called "bounded rationality." We literally can't think of everything.
At some point we have to shrug our shoulders and give it a go. Of
course, this would have been stamped out as an evolutionary behaviour
long ago if it were always fatal. But it occasionally pays off.

### The hiding hand

And as a society, as a *species* we're curiously, sometimes
terrifyingly, tolerant, even encouraging of this. The economist Albert
Hirschman spent a lot of time observing projects in Latin America that
were funded by the World Bank. Many of these projects were set up in
ways that made them unlikely to succeed. But he noticed that, even so,
the people who were working on these projects would play down the risks
and overstate the potential benefits. Hirschman called this "the hiding
hand." This is a reference to a phrase used by an early economist, Adam
Smith. His idea was that a "guiding hand" seemed to be deciding the
price of products in a market. Of course this isn't really what's
happening. Where there is a shortage of something, prices go up, when
there's a glut prices go down. But it seems like there's a single
force that's deciding the price.

Hirschman is suggesting that something similar is happening with new
projects. Rather than a guiding hand, there is a hiding hand. It looks
like all of the people in a project are conspiring to look the other
way. They are pretending to not notice the huge risks and the low
likelihood of success. Someone says fuck it and they go along.

### Legibility

A crucial part of this is legibility. Or rather illegibility. When a
project starts off, and especially when a project is in progress, it's
not a good idea to be totally clear about the risks and costs. This is
what everybody is cooperating with in the hiding hand. Clarity and
legibility will not help garner support. Funding is unlikely to come
from outsiders. And is going to be even more difficult to get if every
potential problem is starkly highlighted.

### Heads I Win Tails you lose

Why are some people much better at kicking off projects than others? Is
it because they have better ideas? Is it because they're better at
execution? Or is it because they are relatively confident that no matter
what happens to the project, they will be OK?

This seems like I'm being critical. But it's one explanation of the
hiding hand, and it's a very good explanation of why anyone might want
to carry on on a project that they regard as impossible. Why are you
carrying on? Because you think you can profit from it, even if the
project itself is a failure. This is a perfectly valid strategy while
working inside a project.

1. Create a project that promises (vaguely) a great deal.

2. Maintain contact with the project.

3. If the project looks like it's going to be a disaster, distance
yourself from it.

4. If the project looks like it's going to be a success, make sure
that you're associated with it.

5. If the project crashes and burns, make sure that you're nowhere
near it and heavily involved in the creation of the next project.

Of course, I forgot a step.

0. Say Fuck it.

This is an absolutely vital thing to understand about any project that
isn't totally boring and simple. Any project of any complexity is
simply too complicated for anyone to have considered all of the risks,
costs and issues involved. Rationality has bounds. Like Grippipe Thin,
you can't think of everything. If a project is going ahead, someone,
somewhere has said fuck it.

But a lot of the time, and this is the same for the people working on
the project, they will get paid if the project succeeds and they will
get paid if the project fails. And most of the time, they also have the
option to jump ship and find another project. So that's what the hiding
hand is, it's a lot of other people joining in and saying, "fuck it."

## Why should anybody care?

The people who kicked off the project, if they've kicked it off in the
right way, are adopting a "Heads I win, tails you lose attitude." The
people who are working on the project are getting paid anyway. Why
should anybody care about a project? That would seem to be a pretty dumb
thing to do, to care about a project when it's irrational for anyone
else.

The main reason is that projects can discover value. They can make
people's lives better, more entertaining, easier. And of course, if
they can do this, they can make money or prestige for the people who own
those projects. But have we been too cynical and cruel about the people
who work on these projects? Yes, they want to get paid, but most of them
also want to do good work and want to be associated with a project
that's a success.

And we have probably been too brutally hard on those people who said
"fuck it." They got the project started when others would have worried
too much about the risks and costs. They would also dearly love to be
associated with a project that's a success.

## What makes a project fly?

When a project delivers value that outweighs the risks and costs, it's
flying. Initially, that value is vague perceived value. But at some
point, there has to be a transition to actual value. This is the tricky
phase on all projects. Because it requires clarity and legibility. And
clarity and legibility undermine and attack perceived value and
perceived cost.

## Why am I so angry with the people pushing these ideas?

So, if this is the way that projects work? Why am I so angry with people
who talk in terms of the shiny dream and the values? I also like to get
paid. When I start a project, I've pretty much no idea whether it will
succeed or not. I'm part of the hiding hand. And part of my strategy is
"Heads I win, tails you lose." I haven't gone down with every failing
project that I've been involved in. If the project is obviously going to
be a failure, I can, and have, walked away.

Part of my anger is that I'm trying to get the project to "fly" to
generate enough "lift" from real value that it can succeed and have a
life of its own.

## The other end of this. What about Steve?

Jeff is my friend. Jeff used to be a Scrum Master like me. Jeff has been
kicked upstairs. He now manages literally hundreds of Agile coaches and
scrum masters. Jeff said something to me that was interesting. But I
didn't like it, I didn't want to hear it. Jeff said that he would be
more impressed with Scrum masters if any of them were delivering their
own software projects. But he didn't know of any who were. Why might
that be? Possibly it's because they don't have the skills, connections
and courage to put together the first half of the project. That's the
bit where people are willing to invest time, effort and money in
something that is just a dream. They don't have whatever it takes to
say, "fuck it." Is that it?

Another reason of course is that they're too emotionally invested in
the reality end.

These things are in opposition in projects.

The dream is in opposition to the reality.

Expenditure is in opposition to revenue, and ultimately profits.

### All is in opposition to some

This is a reference to the theories of a Chilean Pyschologist and
Psycholanalyst -- Ignacio Matt Blanco. His idea is that there's an
opposition between an "all" way of thinking and a "some" way of
thinking.

More specifically, he connects the "all" way of thinking to our
subconscious and the "some" way of thinking to our conscious mind. There
is a similar opposition, and a relationship between the subconscious and
the conscious mind and the concepts of "Same" and "different".

Most projects have some kind of "all" or "same" in their description.
And that "all" or "same" is a connection to the subconscious, the dream
world, the things that we know that we responds to , that we categorise
without thinking.

And now it's a bit more obvious why this book has such a contradictory
title. Because it's trying to capture both ends of this see-saw.

I think it goes the other way round.

What's impossible is in opposition to what's deliverable.

And I want to write here "Money or sense."

Because the phrase that keeps coming back to me is by Buckminster Fuller
- "you can either make money or sense."

So maybe the way through this is to get on the other end.

I was thinking, become a product owner. Indeed, it would be interesting
to become a product owner. Because the product owner sits in the middle
of this nonsense or sense contradiction.

Now I'm thinking that that isn't far enough back up the pipe.

What I'm also thinking is that maybe I need to go "Full
spend-everything nonsense dreamer who wants it all and says fuck it."

Maybe I need to be that person.

There's another thought to blend into this mix. This is that the
software that dominates the world at the moment has been instigated by
people who have sight of both sides of this divide. Mark Zuckerberg was
a techie. Bill Gates was a techie. The two guys that built Google were
techies.

## Chapter REDUCTION - Harm Reduction - Safe drugs, safe sex, safe SAFE
=========================================================================

Despite your best efforts, people will do mad stuff. But there are still things that you can do to stop the mad and bad stuff being fatal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Connection

This chapter might sound a bit crazy. It suggests drug addiction, unsafe
sexual practices and project management have some things in common. That
sounds crazy right? And yes, I am being a bit dramatic. Most projects
don't result in death if they go wrong. But they can result in extreme
expense. And they can be very miserable to work on.

### Concept

If people want to do something because they like how it makes them feel,
they will do it, almost no matter what. They will ignore what bad things
will happen as a result. If people want to avoid doing something because
they don't like how doing it makes them feel, they will avoid doing
that, no matter what. They won't think about the bad things that will
happen.

Part of the reason for this is the relationship between the delayed
gratification and the instant gratification.

On the one hand there is the long life free from sexual disease. On the
other hand, there is a quickie.

On the one hand there is a healthy old age free from self-inflicted
psychological and neurological problems. On the other hand, there is a
chance to get totally out of it and forget all of your immediate
problems.

On the one hand...

Does this even work for software development? Am I pushing a metaphor
just too far? What's the huge payoff for "dangerous behaviour" in
project managment? The huge, instant payoff is in being able to pretend
that your problem is solved. That this new thing will solve, if not all
your problems, then a lot of them. That this new thing will make the
company a lot of money, or save the government department a lot of
criticism and boring manual processing. Make the reputation of the CEO
or founder, allow the company to be sold off for millions.

What's the risky behaviour? The risky behaviour is buying dreams.
Persuading others to buy dreams. That doesn't sound that so bad does
it?

And what's the "safe" behaviour? The safe behaviour is iteratively
and incrementally trying to implement those dreams. The safe behaviour
is modifying the dream in light of actual experience. The safe
behaviours are the things that we talked about right at the beginning of
the book. There is no way of being safe without "tackling the pirate
ship." There is no way of being safe without identifying the big threats
to the project and then you need to tackle them. You need to understand
the swamp, its inhabitants and its landlords. You need to understand the
values and needs of the people who are funding the project. And you also
need to know about the people who might regulate this system, the
governors. Last but not least, you need to understand the people who
might use the system. If you want to practice "safe project
management" a lot of your activities will be focused on increasing
knowledge and understanding.

But there are other dangerous behaviours which don't relate to the
immediate moment of gratification. And as with other areas where people
are tempted to behave riskily, these have to do with bad news and
contra-indications.

If you're a senior person who has started a project, what do you do
when that project is showing signs of going wrong? Do you ignore it and
hope it will go away? Do you try to front it out with positivity? Or do
you take it seriously? And here the meta of dangerous behaviour does
hold across, sex, drugs and project management. Do you get tested and
understand that the results of those tests might require a change in
behaviour?

### Concrete example

SAFE is supposedly an acronym for "Scaled Agile Framework." Although of
course, it's a "backronymn". SAFE draws on Agile, Lean and systems
thinking to paint a picture of how an entire organisation might go about
doing software development.

Key aspects of safe are that a programme is divided into projects. Each
of these projects is called an "Agile release train." In SAFE the Scrum
Master has morphed into an "Agile release train manager."

Agile release trains are chunks of work that are agreed at quarterly
PIPs "Programme implement planning" meetings.

To connect this the subject of this chapter, SAFE, is about instant
gratification for some people, although it causes pain and misery for
others. SAFE is designed to appeal directly to senior managers. I have
seen the hypnotic look that senior managers get on their face when they
talk about SAFE.

This is the message that SAFE whispers in the ears of senior managers.

"Pay lots of money for an army of SAFE-trained and certified coaches."

"You can have vague ideas for entire programmes of work."

"They can be implemented in the way that you think that programmes of
work should be implemented - top down and waterfall."

"You give the orders, they're obeyed."

This is the thing that it's taken me way too long to realise.

You can't stop senior people engaging in "dangerous" behaviour. And
in software development, please turn off your irony meters, because one
of the most dangerous behaviours is called "SAFE".

Why is SAFE so dangerous? Is there anything that can be done about it?
SAFE is dangerous mainly because it is such an such an exquisitely
attractive boardroom sales pitch. It deliberately ignores the most
important thing about any agile method. There is nothing on its diagrams
about feedback. It says close to nothing about inspection and
adaptation. It pays lip service to the idea of Agile. But then there is
no real implementation of the key Agile idea of "Responding to change
instead of following a plan."

Why do we need feedback? Why should we respond to change instead of
following a plan? Think about a classic kind of control problem, a
computer controlling a robot arm.

Sure *control* consists of being able to tell the arm to move forward,
lift up and crucially, to grab things. But if you're getting a robot
arm to pick up something - like, say, a cup, the robot arm needs
*feedback*. It needs to know when it's touched the cup. To pick the
cup up, the robot arm needs to know when it's exerting enough pressure
on the cup to get a grip. And it needs to stop exerting pressure before
it breaks the cup to smithereens.

As it lifts the cup up, it doesn't want to spill whatever is in it.
This means that it needs to move at a different speed, and with a
different pattern of acceleration depending on how heavy the cup is.
What kind of liquid is in the cup? The arm might need to move
differently depending on that. So now we might be thinking that it
isn't enough to have pressure sensors on the fingers and weight sensors
in the muscles. It also might be good to have some visual sensors. And
also, some high-level, overall analysis of what we're getting from the
sensors.

OK, that was just one arm. Imagine that you're trying to control an
octopus. Eight arms. Or a really big organisation with 20 arms, 100
arms. What if you design a structure to send out instructions to those
arms and this structure doesn't involve any feedback? There are no
sensors, no sense of touch. No sense of smell.

One of the things that makes recreating human arms with robots so
challenging is that we have senses that provide us with feedback, that
were hardly aware of. We have senses that sense how fast our arm is
moving, and sense where it is in space, which way is up, and which way
is down. This sense, sometimes called the sixth sense, is
proprioception.

Without proprioception to sense the position of each of these arms and
all of the other senses. One arm literally does not know what the other
is doing. When one arm is punching into the side of the other, neither
knows what's happening (no sense of touch, no sense of proprioception).
What if one arm knocks over a naked flame and starts a fire? The arm
can't hear the noise that it's knocked something over. It can't smell
the smoke. One of the other arms doesn't know that it's burning. This
is what any control system looks like that doesn't have feedback.

SAFE, as it's advocated in the diagrams that sell SAFE, is, literally,
senseless.

### Conclusion

This is what's missing from SAFE. A discussion about feedback. Why? If
feedback is so necessary, why is it missing from SAFE diagrams.

Do feedback loops look scary? Do they put off the decisions makers who
buy SAFE? Let's imagine for a moment that the SAFE marketing process is
trance induction. The expression that I've seen on senior managers'
faces when they talk about it rather makes me think that it is. The
waterfall top-down diagram is matching the senior manager's thinking
about how a project should work.

What if we add feedback loops to this diagram. What if we suggest that
the senior manager's idea about how a project will work might need
correction? What if we mention some obvious problems that we've already
found? Now we're not pacing. Now we're arguing. We're going to bring
the senior manager out of a trance.

Do you know what this reminds me of? Although I feel slightly crazy
saying it, it reminds me of the objections to condoms. The objection
that involving condoms in the "love-making" process somehow spoils the
moment.

I don't know anything about heroin users. But maybe there's a similar
objection with heroin users. There's a camaraderie to sharing needles.
Going and getting clean needles from a clinic is, well, clinical and
also, going and getting needles from a clinic means admitting that you
have a problem.

So, the challenge is to get horny people, drug takers and senior
executives, to incorporate safe practices into their risk-taking.

## Chapter TRENCH - Recognising trench warfare and knowing when to walk away
==============================================================================

Some projects are never going to deliver. Or they're going to deliver so slowly and with so much damage to the people who are working on them that they still should be avoided. An important part of being able to deliver possibly projects is being able to spot and get yourself out of the ones that are impossible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> Following World War I, "trench warfare" became a byword for
stalemate, attrition, sieges, and futility in conflict.

>> From the "Trench Warfare entry in Wikipedia"

I'm going to use the term "trench warfare" in this chapter. And I'm
going to use it to mean any project which is going to fail unless the
way it is set up, structured and managed is changed.

What I mean by trench warfare is any project that is hugely expensive in
terms of money, effort and human suffering and isn't getting anywhere. A
main cause of trench warfare is a refusal (or active prevention) to deal
with the problems that the project faces. The main effect of this is
pretty much guaranteed failure. But on the way to that inevitable
conclusion, there are more and more strident demands for "agreed"
activity. Activity at almost any cost, no matter how frantic, pointless
and damaging it might be.

Let me give you an example. We were trying to meet a ridiculous
deadline. Two members of my team travelled to a secure site where they
were supposed to be putting our software on a client's machine. They'd
written an installation script to run on a clean machine. The idea was
that would put our software where it needed to be and install everything
else that was necessary for it to run. They'd tried the script on a
practice machine. It had run without any problems. They kept trying to
run the script on the client's machine. It kept failing.

They ran some diagnostic tests. The machines that they were putting the
software on were supposed to be "clean". They weren't supposed to
have any other software installed on them - just have the base operating
system. The tools we had to check for problems showed that there was
already software running on the machines. And this was clashing with the
stuff that we were trying to add. When the guys from my team pointed
this out to the people who were supplying the servers, things started to
get very weird. The guys from my team wondered if there'd been a
mistake. They pointed out that there was software that was running on
the servers that they didn't expect. Maybe some other software had been
installed. Could it be uninstalled, so the guys from my team couldget
their installation working.

The guys who owned the server wouldn't say. They were very tightly
lipped. They refused to acknowledge that was any extra software running
on the servers. Something was clearly wrong, but we didn't know what,
and the guys from the server company weren't saying.

A few days later. A Sunday afternoon and I'm in an emergency meeting.
The topic of the emergency meeting started out as "What are we going to
do about the failure of the team to load our software on the client's
machine?" The client was implying very strongly that the reason we'd
failed was because our guys weren't up to the job. But just like the
guys in the server room, when I brought up the subject of the other
software already running on the servers, the client became evasive. He
moved the topic of the emergency meeting onto what we should do about
our four o'clock emergency meeting. Our three o'clock emergency
meeting had overrun so long that we were now in it. Or were we? Clearly
this was something that we needed to spend time on our weekend to
discuss.

Ultimately the mystery of the software already running on the clean
servers was solved. The company that was providing the servers was in
dispute with the client organisation. While they were in dispute, they
were working to the letter of their old written agreement. The original
agreement had been written months ago. It mentioned some software that
should be installed. In the nature of projects, as they progress, it had
turned out that it was better if the server guys didn't install software
and left it to us. But the contract, the one that the server guys were
arguing about said that they should install software, so that's what
they were going to do. The server guys were providing servers that
already had this software, even though they knew it would break ours.

That's part of why they were behaving so oddly. But the other part is
that the written agreement to provide the servers was classified as
secret. So even as they saw our guys failing, and they knew why, they
felt they weren't legally allowed to tell us.

Eventually we found out. Eventually it was admitted that there was no
chance that the project could go live that week. I left the project the
next week and I never heard of it again, I'm certain it never
delivered.

How did I know to walk away? I've worked on other projects that were
struggling and I haven't walked away. I've stuck with them. Some of
those projects succeeded, some of them didn't. But something made me
absolutely certain that I needed to get off this project. Even if I
wasn't explicit about it, I think I was using this rule. I wouldn't say
it's as strong as a law, but it's a very good rule of thumb. I call it
the "Three nonsenses rule."

The rule goes like this.

>> Most projects are going to be labouring under some delusion. There
will be something about the project that doesn't make sense. Often this
will be a delusion about how long the project will take to deliver, or
how much it will cost. Sometimes, the delusion will be that this new
product is guaranteed to be a success. Sometimes the delusion might be
that some new technology that hasn't quite been developed yet will
change everything. Sometimes the delusion is that successful projects
can be delivered at all by the organisation that's funding it. Despite
all evidence to the contrary. Despite all the still-visible wreckage of
previous disastrous projects.

It took me a long time to realise the chances of a project having no
delusions is nearly nil. You probably need to let a project have at
least one delusion. Fighting to make a project completely delusion-free
is a lost cause.

But bitter experience has taught me that delusions when combined, don't
add, they multiply. Crazy and crazy isn't twice as crazy. It's crazy
squared. And if you add in a third delusion, that's crazy cubed.
That's crazy in every direction, forwards, backwards, up, down, left
and right.

Working late. Working weekends, holidays being cancelled or the boss
making sideways comments when team member take them. There is an
insistence on a "positive, can-do attitude." These are signs that
you're working on a trench warfare project. At the same time, trying to
deal with the problems that the project faces is not well received.
It's regarded as "negative" or "defeatist".

Leaving drinks every Friday? People on your team being signed off
long-term sick? Or with stress? Ex-members of the team bringing lawsuits
against the company? These are also signs.

I must confess, I still haven't found a way of remaining calm when I
get a certain kind of complaint from senior management. The complaint is
that the team isn't looking stressed enough.

I have not found a way of communicating - without also giving away how
annoyed I am - the basic truth about software development. Software
development is about the "three Ts" - typing, thinking and talking.
None of these are helped by being tired. None of these are helped by
being stressed. None of these can be done well at three in the morning.
The shouldn't be being done at all at three in the morning. Software is
an activity for the daylight hours when everyone is rested and everyone
is available for a conversation.

A trench warfare project is a bad situation. Experience of working on
one can be one of the best reasons to get over your reluctance to tackle
issues as soon as they come up. Once you have worked on a trench warfare
project, you might be much keener to call out problems the minute you
see them. But most projects have ridiculous timelines. You find them
everywhere. They are the norm.

OK, so this project isn't being realistic about the deadline. That
greatly increases the chances that they are also not being sensible
about some other things. Maybe they are ignoring all the indications
that the fancy new technology that the project uses isn't ready. Or
maybe they are trying to get the project delivered "under the radar".
Even though they know full well that at some point the giant "Monty
Python" foot of regulation is going to stop it dead in its tracks.

I don't know if the real-life Jerry Springer actually said this or not.
But in *Jerry Springer the Opera* the character of Jerry Springer says
something that has stuck with me ever since I heard it: "I don't solve
people's problems, I televise them."

If you are working on a trench warfare project, that is exactly what you
should be doing. Sure, go one better than Jerry, and solve the problems
that you can solve, but the problems that you cannot solve? Broadcast
them. Make sure everybody on the project knows what those problems are.

Why? Because someone else may, if they want the project to succeed, be
able to solve them. Another way to look at this is to look at some of
the people who are giving you and your team a hard time. Those people
who are saying that your team dosn'tlook worried or stressed enough.
Those people who are saying that members of your team don't care about
the project. I mean look! They took the whole weekend off!

Why are people behaving like this? Because,let's be very clear. It
doesn't work. It doesn't make the project more likely to succeed. It
makes the project more likely to fail. Code written at 2am on a Sunday
morning is not going to make a project succeed. Most of Monday and
Tuesday, if you're lucky, January and February if you're not, is going
to be spent finding and taking that exact same code out again.

It might be that some of those people are only doing those things
because they have no idea what else they can do. They want to make the
project successful. They do not know how. What if you do make clear what
the problems are that your team is encountering? You are giving those
people who do want the project to succeed a good solid opportunity to
help.

The second thing that you can do is to deliver some of the things that
some people want to some of the people who want it. This might not be
anywhere near everything that has been asked for by the deadline. But if
you can find one bit of software that you can release to some people who
want it, you can completely change the nature of a project. In Agile
terms, this is called "pull." Pull from outside a team that comes from
demand from real users can be a wonderful thing.

Thirdly, one of the most revolutionary things that you can do, is to
track and show the actual progress of a project.

This might be tough, but few things are as powerful as showing actual
progress relative to the project's needs and expectations. In a way,
this is just a more extreme version of the "Jerry Springer" principle.
This is one of the most powerful manoeuvres that I think an Agile
project manager has in their toolbox.

If I'm a one-trick pony, this is my trick. Capturing and then showing
actual progress.

What? OK. Here's what you do. And it can work on most projects.

1. Get a list of things. For now this can be a list of everything that
anybody has ever thought this project might do. This might not be easy.
The list of things that product needs to do, might not be collected
together anywhere, it might be in emails, it might be just in the air
with promises for functionality discussed briefly in meetings but never
written down.

2. Give these things a score. A number showing how big they are
relative to each other.

3. Start to track progress. How many of these things have been done? If
something is big? What percentage of it is done? Can it be broken up
into things that are done and aren't done?

4. Put this progress on a chart.

5. Deal with the wailing and gnashing of teeth. Deal with the personal
attacks, threats, denial and backstabbing. Watch out for underhand
manoeuvres.

6. Over a period of, probably not just weeks, probably months, track
progress. After a month, how big is the backlog? Did it get bigger? Did
more stuff get added in? Did it get smaller? Did senior stakeholders see
the chart and realise that there was no way they were going to get some
of the features that had initially been discussed?

By doing this, by somehow quantifying the size of the problem and
putting it in a chart,you're tapping into one of the fundamental ways
in which people think. This is identified by the Nobel prize-winning
psychologist Daniel Kahneman in his book *Thinking fast and slow*.
What's this way of thinking?

>> What you see is all there is.

Daniel Kahneman's point is that a lot of our irrational behaviour and
poor thinking can be explained by this principle. We don't do our
thinking based on all the facts. We do our thinking based on what we can
immediately bring to mind. This has one very interesting implication. If
you can change what people see, if you can change what they bring to
mind, you can change what they think.

This is what we're doing by collecting together a list of all the work
that needs doing and then tracking progress through it.

Actually, you know when I said that I was a one trick pony. Well, I've
remembered a few more tricks. Actually, three more tricks.

1.  A risks and issues table -- if possible, together with a chart.

Whatever is bothering you -- put it in a risks and issues chart. For a
long time in my project management career, my experience was that risks
and issues documents were "information refrigerators" -- they were
places that bits of information went to grow mouldy and shrivel up.

But in a project that I worked on recently, the product owner found a
format for risks and issues that seems to work extremely well and I've
used it on all the projects I've worked on since.

2.  Working software

> Get something that works and release it somewhere. Ideally, if it's
> possible, release it to the world. This is so important that we're
> going to devote a whole chapter to it.

3.  User research

> If you're project is a full-on trench warfare project, it's very
> unlikely that it has dedicated user researchers. That would be ideal.
> But even if it hasn't that doesn't mean that you can't put working
> software in the hands of potential users and get their feedback on it.
> There may well be extreme restrictions on who you're allowed to show
> the software to. It maybe government or commercial classified, but
> there are almost always people inside your organisation who are
> cleared, or can be cleared to see what you're working on.

This can then, sometimes, result in delivery of a small bit of working
software to some of the people that want it. It may well seem that a
project is dug-in, going nowhere and doing nothing but damage to the
members of its team. But it's still worth doing these fourthings.

1. Be honest about problems the project is facing.

2. Track actual progress.

3. Push as hard as you can to get working software in the hands of end
users.

4.  Do user research.

Actually there's a fifth thing.

4. Look after yourself. Go home on time. Take your weekends off. Take
holidays. See friends. Kiss your partner. Kiss your kids. Kiss the dog!
Take it easy forget about the shit show you'll be walking into again on
Monday morning.

Keep doing these things. I mean all of them. Points one, two, three and
four and absolutely, definitely point five. Doing these things is the
best way that I know to save the trench warfare project that you're
working on. But equally, it's important to remember that some projects
cannot be saved. Not by you. Not right now.

It's also important to understand that trench warfare was, at the time,
an insoluble problem. Eventually the war ended. And there was the idea
developed in English language commentaries that the allied soldiers were
"Lions lead by donkeys."

But one of the points made by Norman Dixon in his book *The psychology
of military incompetence* is that this is unfair for two reasons.

Firstly, the selection process. This might not have been explicit, or
official. But the process by which officers rose to the most senior
ranks in the British Army was one that didn't think innovation was
important. Initiative and a willingness to challenge the status quo
might be really useful in a war. They're pretty dangerous qualities to
encourage in the military in peacetime. The result was that the kind of
people who were leading the British army weren't innovative, creative
problem solvers.

Secondly, trench warfare was a hard problem.

Trench warfare was "emergent behaviour". It came out of a combination
of technological and strategic techniques. The very short version is
that guns got a lot better. The technological way out of the impasse
probably involved the use of tanks. Probably, but not obviously. Tanks
weren't technologically far enough evolved. Their potential as
battle-winning weapons wasn't obvious or, crucially, immediately
exploitable.

A solution might have been the devolution of some decision-making to
small semi-autonomous groups. Maybe. This was something that the German
side did experiment with late in the war. They were starting to have
some success when the whole German nation ran out of food.

So, if your project is in a total impasse, it might be that there is a
way out of the trenches using innovation. A novel combination of
practice and technology might result in some powerful improvement.

An entirely different way of thinking about a trench warfare project is
that it's an opportunity to try anything else.

I don't *think* I've ever worked on a project that was being
deliberately targeted to fail. But maybe I have. I have heard talk of
such projects.

I worked for a global consultancy. I was talking to the guy who was our
main sales contact with a UK bank. I happened to mention a project that
I'd been trying to help. They were in deep trouble, I could see, but I
couldn't exactly figure out why.

"Oh, yeah," he said, grinning. "We're letting that project fail."

"What?"

"Yes, when we sold them the team to work on the project, we tried to
sell them our banking engine at the same time. They bought the team, but
they insisted on using this other banking engine. So, we're going to
let the project fail. Then we'll suggest that they use our banking
engine."

It is important to understand that you don't need to stay on any
project that is failing. The people in the real trenches had to stay. If
they didn't, they'd be shot for desertion. You don't have to.

Of course, you can nearly always just find a new job. When you start to
look you might be astounded to find that you're not the only person on
that project. Others might also be looking. Recruiters have a very good
idea about which projects are going badly.

But if you're in an organisation big enough to have more than one
project on its books, you can probably get moved off a trench warfare
project.

Of course, you don't have to leave. You could just stay and get paid.
You could look like you're paying attention whenever the bosses are
around. You could pretend that the endless deadlines that come and go
mean anything. Every now and then, you could stay late, or work all
weekend to show that you're really dedicated to the cause.

Of course, none of this is going to make the project any more likely to
succeed. At some point, someone is going to realise that the project is
going to be a failure and pull the plug. But you're getting paid,
right? You're inside, out of the bad weather, and there's no heavy
lifting involved.

I don't know, I can't do it. But I've seen enough software
development projects to know that a lot of people can. In fact, for some
people and some companies, it seems to be pretty much their business
model.

What if you're one of the bosses of this project? What if you own this
mess? What can you do?

First: find out what the real problems are that the project is facing.
If a project is really failing, it's very probable that your teams
won't be running retrospectives, so you might not know. Ask your teams
to run retrospectives. Ask them to just tell you the top three things
that are limiting their progress. Actually, get them to tell you just
one thing that's limiting their progress.

What is that thing that's stopping them? How can something be done to
address it? And then be Jerry Springer about that thing. Televise it.
Let everybody who should be interested and everyone who could possibly
do something to fix that problem know about it.

The first of these is to understand the value environment that you're
working in and delivering to. And the metaphor we use in this book is
exploring the swamp. The second is to deliver working software.

## Chapter CONCLUSION - Conclusion
====================================

Tackle the pirate ship. How? Use agile. Agile is nothing more than a bunch of tactics for delivering the an empirical process. Transparency, inspection and adaptation.  Understand that every project is a swamp. It needs exploring. User research is a big part of that, but so is the adventure of releasing working software.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, this book has discussed a lot of different ideas. A lot of different
ways of looking at the world and specifically a lot of different ways of
looking at projects. And, in the end, all of these different ideas boil
down to a series of questions. Questions that you can ask yourself.
Questions that the team can ask themselves. Questions that you could
even possibly talk through with the client, if you have a close enough
relationship. And the answers to these questions are mostly definite
actions that can be taken to increase the chance of delivering your
project.

The idea: what you see is all there is, which we get from Daniel
Kahneman.

Imagine a woman being sawn in half. You see her head. You see feet. You
see the casket being split into two separate parts.

If what you see is *really* all there is, what do you do if you want
to change what people think? You probably have to change what they see.
And so, the question that comes out of this way of seeing that suggests
a potential course of action is: What can we change that people see, so
that their behaviour also changes?

In my own account of "Fried Egg Agile," I've talked about how I've
used burn-up charts to help to deliver several projects on time.

Imagine that rather than looking at your team, you're looking at that
team over there. This isn't a team that you're connected with. This is
a team that you don't have any stake in. You don't desperately want
them to do well.

How are *that* team going to do? Are they going to do well? What
problems might that team have?

Also from Daniel Kahneman, the planning fallacy and associate with the
planning fallacy, the inside view and the outside view.

In terms of Triz:

Which of the problems that you're trying to solve are in fact
insoluble? They simply aren't the kind of problems that can be solved,
they are trade-offs that need to *managed*. If they are trade-offs,
how do you find a sweet spot?

Are there any parts of the process which require something to both exist
and not exist? Is this an opportunity for invention?

Is there is a situation in which you both need something and don't need
it? How could you go about doing that? Are you doing it already (like
having a "servant leader" as the manager of the team).

This is really both the ideas of Keith Johnston and the "SNAFU
problem" as stated by Robert Anton Wilson. Everything is a status
transaction.

In terms of Status, how is what the problem that you're trying to solve
being affected by issues of Status? Are you trying to push / change the
timings of your clients? Are you trying to make them do things that they
don't want to do? What ways of approaching this problem are there that
makes status less of a problem?

Looking at this through the ideas of John Boyd: are you being asked to
speed up quicker than you possibly can? Are you being asked to run at a
top speed that will always be beyond the capacity of the team? Are you
actually been asked to slow down and you don't want to? These are ideas
connected to Boyd's Energy Manoeuvrability Theory. What's important
about an aircraft, especially a fighter plane, isn't its top speed, but
its manoeuvrability. How quickly it can speed up, how quickly it can
slow down and, as well as its top speed, what is the lowest speed that
it can run at and still be manoeuvrable.

Another of Boyd's ideas is the OODA loop, which is one of many versions
of the ideas discussed in the "Car driving" three pillars of the
empirical process. What are you observing that's weird or unexpected on
the project? How does it change our thinking? How does it change our
decisions; how does it change how we act?

In terms of the Cynefin framework, where are we? Are we in a chaotic
situation? Are we in a complex situation? Where does the client think we
are? Where are we being pushed? Are we being pushed from a complex
situation into a chaotic situation? Are we being pushed into disorder?
Are we already in disorder? How do we get out of disorder? What small
steps can we make to take us to somewhere where we know where we are?

## Chapter MANIFESTO -- Epilogue -- A personal manifesto
==========================================================

### A Manifesto

All is the crevasse - partial is the path. Always? Ha! No, sometimes. Probably most times. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to help you and me get to the point where we're all more
confident that we can deliver the seemingly impossible. That's going to
be a long trip. On that trip, I want to be a reliable guide. So, to help
keep myself straight, and to reassure you somewhat, here's my
manifesto.

1. Tell the truth.

2. Don't over promise.

3. Be clear, don't know it all.

4. Point to sources and interesting things.

1. There is a great temptation to try to write books like this from the
point of view of an absolute expert. Why? I don't know. I'm not an
absolute expert. I've been doing this a while. I have some strategies
that work fairly reliably. I don't have a rigid method that I follow.

2. Pretty much, see point 1. Obviously, I can't promise that you will
deliver the impossible. The thing that you're looking at that seems
impossible may well be exactly that. I worked on a project once that had
all the normal hallmarks of an impossible project. It had an
"aggressive" deadline. It had a strict separation between subject
matter experts and the development team. There were no members of the
team who were trying to talk to users or trying to talk to people in the
wider organisation. But this project also had something else. It had an
absolute reliance on a database that didn't exist. All the diagrams and
sketches of this project showed this database. This database was
essential to the functioning on the project. This was a database that
the development team had to draw up data protocols to communicate with.
It didn't exist. This project was never going to succeed.

3. Think about it for a second. Nobody knows it all. I'm pretty much
trying to tell you everything that I know. There might even be a chance
that combining that with what you know makes you much better at managing
and delivering software development than I am.

4. "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are
dreamt of in your philosophy."

### Feedback from readers

### Feedback

I decided to write this book in the open as "working software". And
one of the joys of that is that I get feedback from real users. This
feedback is from someone I've known for years. I'm not sure what his
title is these days. But he's a senior tech guy who still writes
software. Interestingly, It's not enough to have a clean windscreen.
You have to look out of it. And you need to change your behaviour
depending on what you see. There is nothing that can protect you from
your own stupidity.

Two things I'd say about this. Firstly, it's a really bad idea to have
the user researchers working in a dedicated department. They need to be
in the team. Yes, they might also need to regularly meet up with people
of their own skill set. But they need to sit with the team and be part
of the meetings that deliver transparency (stand-up, planning, show and
tell, retro). My experience is that, at least initially, nobody will
like this.

The user researchers would much rather just get on with doing their user
research and then write a report. The developers don't want to have to
change the UI. They don't want to change how a screen loads or totally
rethink the logic of an application, because of research feedback from
users. So, both groups are much more comfortable sitting apart. Why do
you think that is? Does this sound to you a lot like one group agreeing
to mop the ship's floor and another group agreeing to stay in another
corner polishing the woodwork? That's because that's exactly what this
is. Double agreed activity.

If you want the project to be a success, you need to get user
researchers in and amongst the developers. You need to get them to
listen to each other. The more you do this, the better your chance will
be.

The people who are building the swamp need to speak to the people who
are talking to the people who are interested in the swamp.

You might feel bad about this, because, if you know what you're doing,
you will know that you're creating conflict. But the kind of conflict
that you're creating is the kind that we talked about when we talked
about the pirate ship in chapter [Chapter ref].

One way of getting the improvisers to do the interesting thing rather
than the boring thing is to have a director. Is to help them out of
their agreed activity. Have a director who shouts "deal with the pirate
ship." What we're doing here is putting two points of view together
and insisting that rather than just go off and do their own thing, they
figure things out together. It's like someone shouting from the edge of
the stage "come together and sort this out."

Don't worry too much if the user researchers are juniors. Just worry
about getting them to sit with your team and tell your team about what
they're finding. Most software development projects don't have any
user research at all. Also, you never know when some of the people who
seem to you impossibly green will turn out to be stars.

Some more feedback from a reader. I've kept the swear words because I
think it's instructive that people are actually using this kind of
language when they're talking to user researchers.

Well, let's think about this in "Swamp terms." Yes, there are some
people who are very rich and powerful. Ultimately, if they want to build
something in the swamp that nobody wants to live in, they probably have
the power to do that. A good question to ask is if there is *any*
group of stakeholders who could have some influence over these rich and
powerful people. The more stakeholder research you do, the more chance
you might have to discover who these people might be. For example, in
this case, if a form is mandated by government, then there are MPs and
ministers who have some interest.

Users who are forced to comply with regulations often form an interest
group or pressure group. There might be more than one. They represent
those who are being regulated. Often whoever it is who is ignoring
individual users may well still listen to representation from these
groups. Think of it this way. Everybody has a boss, well almost
everybody. And everybody has a constituency, a wider group of people
that they would really like to please and would dearly love not to
annoy.

So, user research isn't enough. You need to be mapping the stakeholders
on your project and figuring out how to get to them. Maybe it's with
user research, maybe it's with working software. I used to be very
scared of ridiculous deadlines (I still don't love them). But what
I've started to see is that they can be used as an opportunity to push
working software further down the pipe. What if part of that process is
getting the software working on a "live" test server? Obviously, it
wouldn't be using real data. But this could be the kind of thing that
pressure groups could get a look at and have an opportunity to provide
their - ahem - feedback.
