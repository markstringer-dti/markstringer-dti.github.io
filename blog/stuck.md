# Stuck
## 30th June 2021

It's the end of June. And this is the one. This time, I'm actually going to finish the book. The trouble is, that I'm stuck. How am I stuck? Well, actually, think I'm stuck in two ways.

First, going over the chapter on additional availability, and then going over the chapter on trench warfare, something surprising happened. I got new ideas and new understanding. But truth be told, they're just tiny green shoots of new ideas - they need developing further.

Second, I feel I need to some reading.

Third, I'm really not sure what to do when a chapter gets too long and ungainly.

Fourth, I've got some other chapters that I want to write. 

Specifically, I want to write about Some and All, I want to write a chapter about using burn up charts to land a project on time and I want to write a chapter called "How do you even Agile?"

This is all I've got at the moment - keep doing *something*. I dunno, maybe read what you've got out loud in the middle of Hackney marshes at dawn. *Something*.
